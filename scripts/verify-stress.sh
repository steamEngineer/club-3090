# Stress / boundary-case test — for KV-cache and prefill-activation-memory
# stress paths that take real time to run. Split out from verify-full.sh
# 2026-04-28 so the fast functional smoke (verify-full.sh) stays under
# ~2 min while these heavier boundary tests are run only when needed.
#
# Run before publishing, after any major patch / vLLM image bump, or when
# investigating prefill-OOM regressions specifically.
#
# This is SLOW (large prompts, long-ctx needle ladder up to ~115K tokens,
# ~25K-token tool prefill) — allow ~5–10 minutes on dual-card, longer on
# single-card configurations where the longest depths get rejected by the
# engine pre-check (HTTP 400, treated as graceful skip).
#
# Checks (in order — Cliff 2 territory deferred to last):
#   1. Long-context needle SMALL rungs (10K + 30K) — recall ladder at 2
#      depths that DON'T hit Cliff 2. Each depth gets its own random secret
#      to defeat caching. Depths above the deployed --max-model-len are
#      gracefully skipped via the engine's HTTP 400 pre-check.
#   2. Tool response prefill OOM — multi-turn payload with ~25K-token mock
#      tool message + tool definition + auto tool_choice; catches the
#      activation-memory peak class of bug.
#   3. IDE-agent one-shot — synthetic Cline/OpenCode-shape prompt: ~5K-char
#      sys preamble + 10 tool schemas + ~350-char user request + max_tokens=2000.
#      Catches Cliff 1 mech B (inductor compile-path FFN intermediate leak).
#   4. Multi-turn agent — sys + tools + user → assistant tool_call → tool reply
#      → user followup. Different inductor compile path than single-turn (#3).
#   5. LCB-coding shape — LeetCode-style problem statement + structured plan
#      request + max_tokens=4096. Catches DS conv state crash class.
#   6. Reasoning-heavy — math/algorithm problem + max_tokens=8192 to give the
#      model real reasoning room. Stresses spec-decode AL collapse + mamba
#      cache_mode='align' interactions.
#   7. Long-context needle LARGE rungs (60K + 90K) — runs LAST because hitting
#      Cliff 2 (DeltaNet GDN forward state OOM at 50-60K single-prompt) crashes
#      the engine on 24 GB single-card. Putting it last preserves engine
#      liveness for probes 2-6 even when 7 inevitably crashes the engine.
#      On dual-card or higher-VRAM rigs that can carry 60K+ this passes.
