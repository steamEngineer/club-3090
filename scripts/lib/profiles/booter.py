"""v0.8.0 Pull-Emit-Derived `[E]` — STEP E3: the derived boot stage.

CONTRACT-4 (the brief's locked E3 spec, boot half). This module owns ONLY
the derived-compose BOOT; it does NOT wire into `run_pull()` (E4), does NOT
download (E2 owns that), does NOT emit the §6 capture artifacts (that is
`capture.py`, also E3 but a separate module), does NOT do a real on-rig boot
(E5), does NOT write docs (E5).

Boot discipline (the proven on-rig `[D]`/Pull-Gate lesson — reused here)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A derived compose boots ONLY with:

  * `docker compose --project-directory <dir> -f <compose> up`  (the
    `--project-directory` discipline — relative volume/path resolution is
    project-dir-relative);
  * the model weights bind-mounted from the HF_HOME host dir
    `<hf_home>/club3090/pulls/<slug-sanitized>/` to the container path
    `/models/club3090/pulls/<slug-sanitized>` — which is EXACTLY the
    `host:container:ro` volume E1's `generate_from_profile()` already emits
    in `compose_text`. It is **NOT** `MODEL_DIR=/mnt/models` (that is the
    curated Path-A convention; a DERIVED model's weights live under HF_HOME,
    per CONTRACT-2 / CONTRACT-3).

`runner` is INJECTABLE. The default runner shells the real `docker compose`;
E3 tests pass a fixture runner so there is NO real Docker / GPU in CI (the
real boot is E5, on-rig). Whatever happens, the boot is ALWAYS torn down on
exit (mirrors the Pull-Gate on-rig harness "always teardown" rule — no
orphaned container/project state, ever).

Public API (stable for E4)
--------------------------

    from scripts.lib.profiles import booter

    with booter.booted_derived(einput, compose_text, *, runner=None) as bt:
        #   bt: BootResult — the server is ALIVE for the ENTIRE `with` body
        #     .ok       -> bool
        #     .seconds  -> float        (wall time of the up->ready probe)
        #     .failure  -> None | "<container-died-reason>"
        #     .endpoint -> str | None   (the OpenAI-compatible base URL when
        #                                ok; None on failure)
        if bt.ok:
            smoke(bt.endpoint)          # server is UP here
            capture(...)                # emitted BEFORE teardown
    # <- teardown (runner.down + rmtree) happens HERE, on context-manager
    #    exit, AFTER the with-body completes (success OR exception); ALWAYS.

`booted_derived` is a `@contextlib.contextmanager`: it brings the server up,
`yield`s a live `BootResult`-shaped handle while the server is UP (so the
caller can smoke + capture AGAINST A LIVE SERVER), and ALWAYS tears the
compose down in its `finally` on `__exit__` — preserving the no-orphan
guarantee (the Pull-Gate on-rig harness lesson) but at the CORRECT scope.

WHY a context manager (the on-rig E5-caught defect this module's history
records): the prior `boot_derived(...) -> BootResult` did teardown in a
`finally` BEFORE the `return` reached the caller — Python runs `finally`
before delivering `return`, so the server was torn down BEFORE the
orchestrator could smoke it -> `ConnectionRefused`, every time, by
construction. Moving teardown to the CM's `__exit__` keeps the always-
teardown guarantee while keeping the server alive for boot -> smoke ->
capture. This is also the reusable lifecycle primitive that the future
`--keep`/serve path, the §7 soak-continuous path, and `[F]` extended
capture become additive consumers of (NOT control-flow rewrites).

`BootResult` IS the §6 capture-point-3 payload source (`capture.py` maps it
to the `{point:"boot", ok, seconds, failure}` artifact — note `endpoint` is
runtime-only plumbing for the smoke prober and is NOT part of the redacted
artifact).
