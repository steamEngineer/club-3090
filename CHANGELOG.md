# Changelog

Auto-generated from commit messages by [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/).
Update flow: write rich commit message bodies → tag → CI regenerates this file
and the GitHub Release notes from the same source. Don't hand-edit below the
header — your changes will be overwritten on the next tag.

**Versioning:** SemVer in `0.x` — treat any minor bump as potentially breaking
until `1.0`. Past CalVer tags (`v2026.05.09`, `v2026.05.10`) are preserved for
history; SemVer takes over from `v0.3.0` onward.

| CalVer tag | SemVer equivalent | Date |
|---|---|---|
| `v2026.05.09` | (≈ v0.1.0) | 2026-05-09 — first tagged release |
| `v2026.05.10` | (≈ v0.2.0) | 2026-05-10 — stack reorg + Gemma 4 INT8 PTH unblock |

## v0.3.2 — 2026-05-10


### ✨ Features

- **feat(quality-test): auto-set BENCHLOCAL_HERMES_RESOLVE_LOCALHOST=1 for localhost URLs** ([83bf73d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/83bf73d3ec464f6a366c074a3d43f203ff1e3444))


When the user runs quality-test.sh with a localhost-style URL
(default `http://localhost:8020`, or any `localhost`/`127.x`/`[::1]`
variant), auto-export `BENCHLOCAL_HERMES_RESOLVE_LOCALHOST=1` so
benchlocal-cli rewrites the hermes-agent's outbound model endpoint
from `localhost:<port>` to `host.docker.internal:<port>` inside the
Docker sandbox container.

Without this, the hermes-agent inside the sandbox can't reach the
host's vLLM (localhost resolves to the container itself) and every
scenario fails with `"API call failed after 3 retries: Connection
error."` — produced spurious 0/20 grades on this rig prior to the
benchlocal-cli runner.py 9c1566f fix.

Skips the auto-set when:
  - User already set the env var (explicit override)
  - URL points at a non-loopback host (real LAN IP, k8s service name,
    host.docker.internal already) — no rewrite needed

Emits a stderr breadcrumb when the auto-set fires so users can see
what changed.



### 🧹 Maintenance

- **chore: trigger v0.3.2 release workflow (GitHub deduped previous tag push)** ([255c743](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/255c743dff59149ef83a06a4e63b0e74153c61cb))


The v0.3.2 tag was originally pushed at commit 64b0474 but GitHub didn't
emit a CreateEvent (likely dedup after delete + re-push to same SHA), so
the release.yml workflow never fired. Empty commit gives the tag a fresh
SHA that GitHub will process cleanly.

- **chore(changelog): automate CHANGELOG + release notes from commits via cliff (Option A)** ([64b0474](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/64b0474a628d5a91222446d90b4974b14ab3237f))


CHANGELOG.md is now auto-generated from commit messages by git-cliff in
the release workflow. Hand-edits below the static header will be wiped on
the next tag.

Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
  - On tag push (`v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`):
    1. Render GitHub Release body: `git-cliff --latest --strip header`
       → just the per-version section, no SemVer preamble repeat
    2. Regenerate full CHANGELOG.md: `git-cliff` (default = all tags)
       → preserves header + all historical sections
    3. Commit CHANGELOG.md back to master with `[skip ci]` marker
    4. Publish GitHub Release with the latest-only body

Template (`cliff.toml`):
  - `[changelog].header` now holds the SemVer preamble + CalVer→SemVer
    mapping table (preserved across regens; stripped from GitHub Release
    bodies via `--strip header`).
  - `body` template now renders the **full commit message** (subject as
    bold bullet, body indented below) instead of just the first line.
    Rich narrative I write in commit message bodies (tables, validation
    numbers, before/after diffs) now flows into both CHANGELOG.md and the
    GitHub Release page from the same source.
  - Per-release Pin/Diff footer guarded with `{% if version %}` so the
    Unreleased section doesn't emit empty links.

CHANGELOG.md replaced with the auto-gen output. Past hand-written tables
and phase breakdowns are replaced by the corresponding commit messages
(those were already rich for commits that mattered — v0.3.1 soak-helper
fix has its Before/After table in the commit body and renders fine).

Going forward: just write rich commit messages and tag. Both surfaces
update automatically. No hand-edit of CHANGELOG.md required.

## v0.3.1 — 2026-05-10


### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **fix(soak-helper): capture `delta.reasoning` alongside `delta.reasoning_content`** ([88eb67a](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/88eb67aa18263a5706268a06d66784987ec69069))


vLLM nightly (0.20.2rc1.dev9+) emits the qwen3 reasoning parser's output
under `delta.reasoning` (legacy field name), not `delta.reasoning_content`
that soak-helper.py was watching. Result: for any thinking-on response
whose `<think>` block doesn't close within `max_tokens`, soak-helper saw
zero deltas → fell back to the "couldn't measure" path → reported
`ttft_ms == t_ms` and `decode_tps = 0.0`. The model was generating
correctly; the harness just couldn't see the wire output.

Repro request (JDWarner's #107 turn 5): math problem with
`max_tokens=2000` + `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=true`.

Before patch:
  status=200  t_ms=22709  ttft_ms=22709  decode_tps=0.0
  completion_tokens=2000  content=""  reasoning_content=""

After patch (same request, same compose, same model):
  status=200  t_ms=22709  ttft_ms=234  decode_tps=88.985
  completion_tokens=2000  content=""  reasoning_content="Here's a thinking
  process:\n  \n  1. **Understand the User's Problem:**\n  ..."  (3959 chars)

Validation soak (fresh-mode, 20 sessions × 5 turns = 100 turns, qwen3.6-27b
dual.yml):
  verdict        PASS
  silent_empty   0 / 100 (0.0%)   ← was ~3-5/40 baseline
  p50_decode_tps 90.22
  p95_ttft_ms    1389
  errors         0
  max_growth     0 MiB / 200

Closes the cross-rig "silent-empty turn-5" pattern parked behind the
Cliff 2b investigation — it was a harness measurement bug, not a model
or rig issue.



### 📝 Documentation

- **docs(changelog): v0.3.1 entry for soak-helper delta.reasoning capture** ([9db8b26](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9db8b2603ca2e9638b533f76e9fbc1aa7bf936a3))


Documents the silent-empty turn-5 root cause (vLLM nightly field-name
shift to delta.reasoning) + validation soak results.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-10


### ✨ Features

- **feat(power-cap-sweep): --include-commit flag stamps club-3090 git SHA in report header (closes #112)** ([7d91ac7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7d91ac75e05eb01c81a30b35d2aa1290d5dc4b7f))


@laurimyllari noted in disc #62 that with the project moving fast,
including the club-3090 git commit in sweep output helps correlate
cross-rig sweeps to the script revision they were run against. He
stamped `aa99173` manually; the script should do it for us.

New flag:

  --include-commit   Stamp the club-3090 git commit (short SHA) in the
                     report header next to the date. Off by default.

Implementation:
- Captures `git -C "$REPO_ROOT" rev-parse --short HEAD` once at header-build
  time (REPO_ROOT was already known to the script).
- Injects into the report header next to **Date:**, e.g.:

    **Date:** 2026-05-10T17:55:00Z &nbsp; **club-3090 commit:** `534d29f`

- Suppress (don't stamp "n/a") when run from a non-clone or git is
  unreachable. Closes the curl-pipe-from-docs UX hole — `curl ... | bash`
  users don't have a clone, so the field just disappears rather than
  showing a confusing "n/a".

Off by default per the issue rationale: surprise stamping confuses
contributors running from documentation snippets.

Closes #112.

- **feat(qwen3.6-27b): thinking OFF by default across all 21 composes** ([29d17ed](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/29d17ed82d5a62191e96284f557686c4baa1cea7))


Previously, all 19 vLLM Qwen composes used --reasoning-parser qwen3 (parses
<think>...</think> output blocks) but did NOT explicitly disable the
thinking template. That meant Qwen3 default — thinking ON — applied
across the board. This burns hidden token budget on internal CoT for
every request, hurts latency, and creates a "Qwen looks much slower
than Gemma" gap on agentic benchmarks (which is exactly what we just
hit on aider-polyglot — Qwen exceeded the 1500s timeout, Gemma
finished in 19 min).

Change:
- All vLLM composes (18 of them) now pass `--chat-template-kwargs
  '{"enable_thinking": false}'` after `--reasoning-parser qwen3`.
- llama.cpp single/docker-compose.yml: DISABLE_THINKING default flipped
  0 → 1 (thinking now OFF by default; opt back in via DISABLE_THINKING=0).
- llama.cpp single/concurrent.yml: gained `--chat-template-kwargs` flag
  with default `{"enable_thinking":false}` (overridable via
  CHAT_TEMPLATE_KWARGS env).

NOT changed:
- bounded-thinking.yml — that's the structured-CoT compose where thinking
  IS the feature. Reverted my initial blanket change for that one.
- qwopus-bf16mtp.yml — already had enable_thinking=false (preview compose).

Users who want thinking ON can:
- For vLLM: pass `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: true}` in the
  per-request body (works fine).
- For llama.cpp: set `DISABLE_THINKING=0` in compose/.env.

Aligns with Gemma 4's "thinking off by default" (it ships that way upstream)
and removes the Qwen vs Gemma framework-bench skew.

- **feat(setup): interactive MODEL_DIR prompt for fresh TTY users** ([3909c2d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3909c2d6b826d40a382fe3554cfe068a81145657))


Previously setup.sh silently defaulted MODEL_DIR to <repo>/models-cache,
which meant fresh users got ~14-21 GB of model weights downloaded INTO
their git tree without realizing it. The relative path is also wrong
when run from anywhere except the repo root.

New 4-step resolution order in setup.sh:
  1. MODEL_DIR exported in calling shell  → use as-is (unchanged)
  2. .env at repo root sets MODEL_DIR     → source it (NEW)
  3. Interactive prompt (only on TTY)     → ask user (NEW)
  4. Silent fallback to <repo>/models-cache (unchanged for non-TTY)

The interactive prompt only fires when:
  - MODEL_DIR is not in the calling env, AND
  - .env doesn't already set it, AND
  - both stdin AND stdout are TTYs (CI / scripted runs unaffected)

Three options offered:
  1. <repo>/models-cache   (the old silent default — kept as option)
  2. $HOME/models           (sensible cross-rig default)
  3. custom absolute path

After picking, optionally persists the choice to .env (gitignored) so
re-runs skip the prompt. Existing .env files are updated in-place if
they already set MODEL_DIR; appended-to otherwise.

Closes the UX hole RobH589 hit in club-3090#116 — the relative
../../../../../models-cache default that was resolving wrong when
not run from the compose dir.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **fix(qwen3.6-27b): use --default-chat-template-kwargs (not --chat-template-kwargs)** ([534d29f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/534d29f1b1da3ff5f34035e01b496db1c565a81b))


Follow-up to 29d17ed which used the wrong vLLM flag name (`--chat-template-kwargs`),
causing boot failure: "vllm: error: unrecognized arguments: --chat-template-kwargs
{"enable_thinking": false}".

vLLM's actual flag for setting server-side default chat template kwargs is
`--default-chat-template-kwargs` (with the `default-` prefix). Confirmed by
- vLLM nightly source: vllm/engine/arg_utils.py defines
  `default_chat_template_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None` with
  json.loads parsing.
- vLLM PR #37739 ("Fix default_chat_template_kwargs handling in Responses API")
  references it as already available in the shared render stack.

Behavior unchanged: thinking OFF by default for all 17 vLLM Qwen 27B composes
(plus bounded-thinking unaffected — it intentionally keeps thinking ON).
Per-request override still works via OpenAI extra_body:
  {"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": true}}

Verified: vllm-qwen36-27b-dual now boots cleanly with the corrected flag.

- **fix: 4 stale refs missed in 2026-05-10 reorg push (caught by RobH589 #116)** ([cf7f195](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/cf7f1959fdd002b4c354aa14ec5ae983aa971c9d))


After the GGUF dir move (/mnt/models/gguf/qwen3.6-27b/ → /mnt/models/
huggingface/qwen3.6-27b-gguf/), four refs were not updated and led to
a path-mismatch loop reported in club-3090#116:

- scripts/preflight.sh `hf download` hint pointed at qwen3.6-27b/, but
  the compose default expects qwen3.6-27b-gguf/. Same for the mv hint
  for mmproj relocation, and the in-container mmproj default at line 329.
- models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/README.md example command still said
  `MODEL_DIR=/mnt/models/gguf` (now /mnt/models/huggingface).
- models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/compose/single/{docker-compose,concurrent}.yml
  header comment said "Q5_K_XL" but the actual default has been Q3_K_XL
  for a while (this one predates the reorg — just stale doc).

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs(benchmarks): aider-polyglot-30 — Qwen 27B 20/30 (66.7%) > Gemma 4 31B 17/30 (56.7%)** ([e08988e](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e08988e6140ea5afc7be46434f0bd1aa0c02096d))


New "Quality benches — Aider Polyglot 30" section captures pass-rate /
agentic-coding signal alongside the existing TPS rows. First two rows:

- Qwen 3.6 27B (AutoRound INT4) on dual.yml: 20/30 = 66.7%, 19 min wall
- Gemma 4 31B (Intel AutoRound INT4) on dual.yml: 17/30 = 56.7%, 19 min wall

Both run on 2× 3090 PCIe, 230 W cap, threads=2. Qwen edges Gemma by +10pp
despite being smaller; java is the biggest swing (Qwen 4/5 vs Gemma 1/5).

Critical caveat documented: Qwen with thinking ON is unusable for agentic
benches on this hardware — hits the 1500s subprocess cap before any
exercise completes. The new --default-chat-template-kwargs flag in our
vLLM Qwen composes (commit 534d29f) sets enable_thinking=false by default.

Aider-polyglot run via benchlocal-cli's aider-polyglot-30 pack. Cross-rig
re-run path documented in the section.

- **docs(recipes): use \$MODEL_DIR placeholder + sensible cross-rig default** ([cc3a717](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/cc3a7175243abe43f21a1eb69ca0015b5a10f7f8))


Two recipe scripts (single-card-default.sh, single-card-max-ctx.sh) had
the dev rig path /mnt/models/huggingface/... baked into the MODEL_PATH
default + the comment-block instructions for downloading the GGUF.

Updated:
- Comments now show \${MODEL_DIR}/qwen3.6-27b-gguf/... as the placeholder
  (matches what the just-fixed README + LLAMA_CPP.md docs say).
- MODEL_PATH default changed from /mnt/models/huggingface/... to
  \${MODEL_DIR:-\$HOME/models}/qwen3.6-27b-gguf/... — falls back to
  ~/models/ if MODEL_DIR isn't set, which is a more reasonable default
  for cross-rig users than our /mnt/models/huggingface/ path.
- file-exists check at line 25 still fails loudly with the resolved path
  if neither MODEL_DIR nor MODEL_PATH is set correctly.

Follow-up to fbf3431 (de-bind \$MODEL_DIR from rig path in docs).

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **docs: use \$MODEL_DIR placeholder, not the dev rig's /mnt/models/huggingface/** ([fbf3431](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/fbf343129ccc48d242178a0d5b57d6def7d5651d))


User docs were hardcoding the dev rig path (/mnt/models/huggingface/...) as
if it was canonical. It's not — cross-rig users have models at /data/models,
~/models, /mnt/nvme/llms, etc. Setting MODEL_DIR per their setup is the
intended UX (the compose already supports it via env-var default).

Updates:
- models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/README.md: download examples now use
  \$MODEL_DIR/qwen3.6-27b-gguf/ instead of /mnt/models/huggingface/...
- models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/compose/single/docker-compose.yml: header
  comment uses \$MODEL_DIR/qwen3.6-27b-gguf/ for download examples + says
  "MODEL_DIR=/your/models/dir docker compose up -d" instead of our path.
- docs/engines/LLAMA_CPP.md: same treatment + cleaned up Qwen3.5 + DFlash
  draft path examples to also use \$MODEL_DIR.
- scripts/preflight.sh: hf download hint shows literal \${MODEL_DIR} so user
  knows what to set, plus explicit "set MODEL_DIR first" line. Previously
  echoed the resolved relative path (../../../../models-cache) which lands
  outside the repo if pwd isn't the compose dir.

Caught by RobH589 in club-3090#116 — they hit the path-resolved-to-root-of-drive
case from the relative-path default. Closes the doc UX side; the compose's
env-var override mechanism was already correct.

### 🧹 Other

- **release: SemVer adoption + v0.3.0 changelog entry** ([7080f1f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7080f1f89b674a0cc5becd361623a0ab6abdd53d))


club-3090 is software (docker composes + system scripts + patch bundles
that downstream rigs run as-is), not just rolling recipes. Switch from
CalVer to SemVer from v0.3.0 onward; past CalVer tags (v2026.05.09,
v2026.05.10) preserved for history.

CHANGELOG.md: convention note + retroactive CalVer→SemVer mapping +
new v0.3.0 (2026-05-10) entry covering 8 commits since v2026.05.10:
- Qwen 3.6 27B thinking OFF default across all 21 composes
- MODEL_DIR UX overhaul (closes #116) — interactive setup prompt,
  $MODEL_DIR placeholder everywhere
- power-cap-sweep --include-commit (closes #112)
- BENCHMARKS aider-polyglot-30 row

cliff.toml: drop "snapshot of the rolling stack — not a versioned
API" framing; add SemVer note. Tag pattern v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+
already matches both CalVer and SemVer, so the cliff release
workflow needs no changes.

### ✨ Features

- **feat(gemma-4-31b): INT8 PTH KV unblocks 262K + AWQ + DFlash compose family** ([403b16f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/403b16f303253430bf58b606da7490d8253b7ef7))


Lands the Gemma 4 31B work that was in flight last week + Qwopus3.6-27B
preview compose. Captures four distinct serving paths for Gemma 4:

- dual/awq.yml — AWQ-4bit (text-only, simplest path)
- dual/dflash-int8.yml — DFlash + INT8 PTH KV (262K ctx, full pipeline)
- vllm-gemma4-dflash-int8/ — vendored patches stacking DFlash spec-decode
  + INT8 PTH KV across model_executor + v1/spec_decode + v1/attention +
  v1/worker (~13 patched files; PR #42102 + #40391-rebased + tool-parser
  fixes #42006 + #41991 stacked)
- vllm-gemma4-fp8-ampere/ — earlier Phase 2 attempt before INT8 PTH
  reframe (kept for forensics); Ampere has no native FP8 tensor cores
- vllm-perheadkv-hybridpage-fix/ — hybrid-page bug fix surfaced during
  Phase 3
- vllm-pr40391-perheadkv/ — PR #40391 vendored at the tree level
  (separate from the rebased variant under refs/jianc99-dflash-gemma4)

Plus:
- models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/dual/qwopus-bf16mtp.yml — preview compose
  for Carnice AutoRound Recipe D output (port 8071, NOT production —
  see club-3090-todo.md for known gaps + cheap A/Bs).
- AGENTS.md — codify compose naming + profile-schema + experimental-compose
  conventions that the new files follow.
- docs/QUALITY_TEST.md — runbook for `quality-test.sh` + the benchlocal-cli
  packs it wraps.

CHANGELOG.md narrative entries for these are added separately.

### 🎯 New models + serving paths

- **compose: parametrize VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER, KV_CACHE_DTYPE, P40/P82/PN54 across all variants (#110)** ([#110](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/110) by @easel)


All defaults unchanged — existing users see identical behavior out of the box.
New opt-ins let RTX 5090 / WSL2 / high-L2 rigs tune without forking files.

Changes across 18 compose files + .env.example:

VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER — hook added to 7 files that lacked it:
  carnice-bf16mtp, dual-dflash, dual-dflash-noviz, dual-nvlink-dflash,
  dual-nvlink-dflash-noviz, dual4-dflash, minimal
  (bounded-thinking, dual, dual-turbo, long-*, tools-text, docker-compose.yml
   already had the hook)

KV_CACHE_DTYPE — parameterised in all 13 variants that hardcoded it:
  turboquant_3bit_nc default: bounded-thinking, docker-compose.yml,
    long-text, long-text-no-mtp, long-vision, dual-turbo, dual-nvlink-turbo
  fp8_e5m2 default: carnice-bf16mtp, dual, dual-nvlink, dual4, minimal, tools-text

GENESIS_ENABLE_P40 + GENESIS_ENABLE_PN54 — opt-in stanzas added to all 8
  Genesis-using variants: bounded-thinking, docker-compose.yml, dual-turbo,
  dual-nvlink-turbo, long-text, long-text-no-mtp, long-vision, tools-text

GENESIS_ENABLE_P82 — promoted from hardcoded 0 → ${GENESIS_ENABLE_P82:-0}
  in 6 spec-decode variants: bounded-thinking, dual-turbo, dual-nvlink-turbo,
  long-text, long-text-no-mtp, long-vision

.env.example additions:
  - Docs for VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER, KV_CACHE_DTYPE, P40, P82, PN54
  - Validated RTX 5090 Laptop + WSL2 profile block (issue #102):
    PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False,max_split_size_mb:512
    GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.94, VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1, GENESIS_ENABLE_P40=1,
    GENESIS_ENABLE_P82=1, SOAK_TIMEOUT_S=3600

- **composes: refresh Quality lines with --full sandboxed (8-pack) results** ([9dea0eb](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9dea0ebb7beb72845a6264664bf5da1bc5c65b9f))


Re-ran --full --enable-sandboxed-packs on both duals to validate v0.4
sandbox infrastructure end-to-end with real model output. Both sandbox
containers (BugFind/CLI/HermesAgent) bring up cleanly; SandboxClient
lifecycle works as designed.

Headline: Qwen3.6-27B 129/150 (86%), Gemma 4 31B 126/150 (84%). Both
score 56/75 (75%) on the deterministic suite; sandbox numbers (97%/93%)
are partly inflated by v0.4 shape-check verifiers — BugFind matches
<solution> blocks, HermesAgent passes any non-empty response, only CLI
applies real shell-parseability + safety checks. Full upstream fixture
parity is queued for v0.5.

Surprising: BugFind 14/15 (Qwen) and 15/15 (Gemma) — both models do
emit solution-block-shaped output without explicit prompting. Suggests
the v0.4 shape-check is more meaningful than I'd expected.

Run on: vLLM nightly 01d4d1ad, 2× RTX 3090 TP=2, benchlocal-cli v0.4.

- **composes: add --full Quality lines on Qwen3.6-27B + Gemma 4 31B duals** ([26ff0e5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/26ff0e58643dae75904f4b1ea4705a5fa32007bc))


Both score 56/75 (75%) on the 5-pack deterministic suite (toolcall,
instructfollow, structoutput, dataextract, reasonmath). Per-pack
breakdown is appended to the Quality: profile field.

Notable: ReasonMath is the weakness on both (Qwen 33%, Gemma 40%) —
verifier requires strict `key=value` final-answer format that neither
model emits without explicit prompting. Other 4 packs unchanged from
the earlier --medium baseline.

Sandboxed packs (bugfind-15, cli-40, hermesagent-20) skipped — gated
on --enable-sandboxed-packs and the v0.4 verifiers are still
shape-checks pending v0.5 fixture parity.

Run on: vLLM nightly 01d4d1ad (2026-05-04 image), 2× RTX 3090 TP=2,
benchlocal-cli v0.4. Endpoints: 8010 (Qwen) / 8030 (Gemma).

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **fix: BIND_HOST opt-in + localhost script fixes (#109)** ([#109](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/109) by @easel)


Three related fixes for running benchmarks without IDE agent interference:

1. All 18 vLLM compose files: port binding is now
   ${BIND_HOST:-0.0.0.0}:${PORT:-<n>}:8000
   Setting BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1 in .env restricts the API to localhost,
   preventing IDE agents (Cline, Cursor) from competing for the
   max-num-seqs=1 slot and causing verify-stress HTTP 000 failures.

2. scripts/preflight.sh: port auto-detection regex now matches
   127.0.0.1:<port>->8000/tcp in addition to 0.0.0.0: and [::]:
   Previously all verify-*/bench scripts silently produced no output
   when BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1 was set.

3. scripts/report.sh: SOAK_TIMEOUT_S is now forwarded to soak-test.sh
   from the shell environment. Previously the variable was read from
   compose .env (docker-compose only) and silently ignored by the
   script, always using the 1800s default regardless of what was set.

Docs: .env.example gains BIND_HOST and SOAK_TIMEOUT_S entries.

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs: WSL2 budget formula + Cliff 3 (DeltaNet SSM-state non-cacheable)** ([6e12700](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/6e12700f9a91c92c3c28c35d25be798745016ee0))


Two findings from @easel's deep cross-rig writeup on issue #102 (5090
Laptop WSL2):

1. **HARDWARE.md** — new "GPU memory budget on WSL2" subsection. WSL2
   container CUDA-context consumes ~1.31 GiB before vLLM profiler runs.
   `gpu_memory_utilization=0.95` crashes at boot; 0.944 works. Validated
   on 2 machines. Formula: `(vram_total - 1.31) / vram_total`.
   Recommendation: `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.94` in `.env` on WSL2.

2. **CLIFFS.md** — new section "Cliff 3 — DeltaNet SSM state is not
   prefix-cacheable (the prefill cliff)". This is a structural finding
   that explains a class of failures we'd been describing without
   naming. @easel's warm-cache run (68.7% KV-block hit, turn 10 at
   35.6K tokens took 577s — 2.3× the cold-start 254s) is the smoking
   gun: prefix cache helps attention but DeltaNet's recurrent state
   `h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t)` must be recomputed from scratch every turn.
   PN32 fixes OOM stability; nothing fixes the O(n) prefill scaling
   because the architecture itself is sequential.

   Practical ceiling on single-card vLLM (any 24 GB Qwen3-Next config):
   sub-30s TTFT only below 5K accumulated tokens. 22-35K = 3-4 min/turn.
   ~74K = 10+ min client timeout.

   Elevates "for single-card agentic Qwen3-Next, use llama.cpp" from
   implied to explicit in the docs. Dual-card extends the envelope to
   25-30K accumulated; deep sessions (50K+) still need llama.cpp on
   either topology.

### 🛠️ Scripts + tooling

- **quality-test.sh: --sandboxed-only passthrough** ([7020d96](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7020d965bdbcc1b4d3bfeadd0c85b030488c1dfd))
- **quality-test.sh: --help, --pack passthrough, align with benchlocal-cli v0.5** ([1be02d2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1be02d22719e78913470e6ee98a17a2b2d46f152))


- Add comprehensive --help with mode descriptions + examples.
- Add --pack PACK_ID passthrough (run a single named pack, overrides mode).
- Add --no-sandboxed opt-out for --full (mirrors benchlocal-cli flag).
- Add --list-packs convenience flag.
- Drop ENABLE_SANDBOXED env var — no longer needed since benchlocal-cli's
  --full now defaults to sandboxed packs.
- Refresh mode descriptions: medium=5 packs (incl reasonmath now), full=8
  packs requiring Docker.

Pairs with benchlocal-cli v0.5.0 (commit eb7ddb0).

- **ci: replace Release Drafter with git-cliff for commit-based release notes** ([7002e6b](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7002e6b550fe357859e34bb6ff15d1e9ae493de4))


Release Drafter only catches PRs; this repo's workflow is mostly
direct-to-master commits per the auto-mode pattern, so 80%+ of
substantive changes were invisible to it.

git-cliff is commit-based: parses every commit since the last tag,
categorizes by conventional-commit prefix (`docs:`, `scripts:`,
`composes:`, `models:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) with keyword-based fallback
for un-prefixed commits (`Document Cliff 1`, `Add Gemma 4 compose`,
`power-cap-sweep:`, `verify-full.sh:`). Squash-merged PRs flow
through the same parsers since their squashed title becomes the
commit message.

Workflow triggers on `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` tag push, runs git-cliff
with `--latest`, creates a GitHub Release with the categorized body.

Tested locally on 274 commits since repo init: 49 land in catch-all
"Other" (genuinely unconventional one-off commits); rest distribute
across 9 categories. Existing v2026.05.09 release stays as-is
(hand-written); next CalVer tag onwards uses this pipeline.

Future cadence: `git tag v$(date +%Y.%m.%d) && git push origin v...`
— workflow does the rest.

### 🧹 Other

- **reorg: services/ consolidation + gpu-mode under git + ComfyUI + pin tracker + path updates** ([00366a5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/00366a58d761ca797581c1411b06c4f6ab98654c))


The dev rig had grown across three home dirs (`/opt/ai/compose/`, `/opt/ai/github/`,
`/home/wasif/`) and three repos (single-3090, dual-3090, club-3090). Disk-out
on `/` (97% used) forced a cleanup; rather than just prune, we consolidated
the layout across the whole stack while we were at it. This commit captures
what landed inside this repo.

Services consolidation:
- services/{ollama,openwebui,litellm,qdrant,searxng}/ migrated in from
  /opt/ai/compose/<svc>/ (zero functional change — same docker-compose.yml).
- services/litellm/config.yaml rewritten: explicit routes for current
  primaries (qwen3.6-27b-autoround → :8010, gemma-4-31b-autoround → :8030).
  Removed `* → ollama/*` wildcard.
- services/comfyui/ migrated in (was /opt/ai/compose/comfyui/) — wired into
  gpu-mode with full mutex against vLLM/SGLang.

scripts/gpu-mode.sh under git:
- Was a loose /opt/ai/gpu-mode.sh outside any repo. Symlinked at
  /usr/local/bin/gpu-mode.
- Five Gemma 4 31B modes added: gemma, gemma-dflash, gemma-int8,
  gemma-dflash-int8, gemma-awq.
- One ComfyUI mode (mutex with all LLM serving).
- prune / prune-all subcommands (safe image prune; aggressive variant adds
  build cache --keep-storage 5GB + dangling networks).
- gpu-mode status now shows Docker disk + /var/lib/docker + /tmp sizes.
- compose_at() passes --env-file <repo>/.env so MODEL_DIR resolves
  regardless of which compose dir gpu-mode cd's into. Fixes the recurring
  "MODEL_DIR not set, defaulting to ../../../../../models-cache" warning.
- stderr no longer swallowed by compose_at() (real errors surface).
- Cross-model VRAM mutex: every Qwen mode stop_all_gemma + stop_comfyui
  and vice-versa.

scripts/maintenance/ — new hygiene-tools subdir:
- list-image-pins.sh: engine-agnostic pin auditor. Scans every compose's
  `image:` line, groups by `<repo>:<tag>`, flags pin-drift (multiple tags
  per repo), ranks composes by patch surface.

Pin tracking:
- docs/UPSTREAM.md gains a "Pinned images" section: table of every pinned
  image, why each pin exists, retirement candidate criteria.
- docs/NIGHTLY_BUMP_RUNBOOK.md (new): 7-step procedure for bumping pinned
  engine images (scope → branch → patch survival → boot → verify-full +
  verify-stress → bench delta → land → retire). Engine-specific notes
  for vLLM nightly hashes, llama.cpp digest pinning, SGLang variants.

Path updates from the engine + model dir consolidation:
- /opt/ai/vllm-src/ → /opt/ai/engines/vllm/primary/
  (in setup.sh, INTERNALS.md, several patch READMEs, docs/HARDWARE.md,
   docs/FAQ.md, docs/DUAL_CARD.md, docs/UPSTREAM.md, models/qwen3.6-27b/
   CHANGELOG.md)
- /mnt/models/gguf/qwen3.6-27b/ → /mnt/models/huggingface/qwen3.6-27b-gguf/
  (in models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/{compose/single/*.yml, recipes/*.sh,
   README.md}, docs/engines/LLAMA_CPP.md)

CHANGELOG.md narrative gap fill:
- 2026-05-10 entry for this reorg.
- 2026-05-09 entry for compose convention formalization (topology
  promoted to dir level, profile schema, Status enum + Caveats, cliff
  CI swap, Discord launch).
- 2026-05-08 entry for Gemma 4 INT8 PTH unblock + 262K validation.
- 2026-05-07 entry for power-cap-sweep campaign + HARDWARE.md cross-rig
  charts + cross-rig benchmark rows.

- **encourage-soak: template dropdown + script ergonomics + report reminder + Notes convention** ([c298b60](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/c298b60f762309d3829a0ce3a45b17ac3ca9224a))


Four small fixes addressing low soak-test compliance in cross-rig bench
contributions. Audit of 5 recent #113/#107/#102/#104/#93 showed soak data
IS being run but it's hidden in the main report and the dedicated
template field comes out empty (template said "leave blank if you ran
--full"). Older BENCHMARKS rows often omit soak verdict entirely.

1. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/numbers-from-your-rig.yml`**: replace optional
   "soak summary" textarea with a required dropdown listing PASS / borderline /
   FAIL / Skipped+reason / Not-yet-run. Verdict is now grep-able even when
   the data is buried in the main report textarea.

2. **`scripts/soak-test.sh`**: add `--continuous` / `--quick` / `--fresh`
   flags + `--help` + cleaner usage docs. Was 5 env vars to invoke
   (`SOAK_MODE=continuous SOAK_SESSIONS=5 SOAK_TURNS=5 CONTAINER=... ENDPOINT=...`);
   now `bash scripts/soak-test.sh --continuous` does the same with
   auto-detect (existing logic preserved + exposed). Env vars still work
   for back-compat.

3. **`scripts/report.sh`**: when `--bench` (or partial) ran without
   `--soak`/`--full`, append a "⚠ Soak: not included" reminder block to
   the report so contributors know what's missing before pasting into
   the issue template.

4. **`BENCHMARKS.md`**: Notes-column convention — every row should start
   with explicit `Soak: ✓ PASS` / `⚠ borderline` / `✗ FAIL` / `—` so
   readers can grep at a glance. Updated 2 recent rows (ygafarov #113,
   JDWarner #107) to use the convention. Older rows backfill as the
   convention spreads.

- **BENCHMARKS: add @ygafarov Strix-Halo + oculink-eGPU x4-PCIe single-3090 row (#113)** ([a589058](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a5890587610404d69819512a32290d87deeb5460))


First Strix-Halo-miniPC + oculink-eGPU class on the matrix. Single 3090
over PCIe x4 (oculink) on AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 / 124 GB RAM / CachyOS /
290W cap. Result: 68.86 narr / 91.70 code TPS via vllm/default + TQ3 at
48K — clean MTP AL 3.31 (77% accept), CV 1.6%/2.7%.

Soak FAIL is borderline (240 MiB > 200 MiB threshold, 3 turns >30s) but
100% TPS retention + 0 errors + 0 silent-empty suggests x4-PCIe accretion
+ bus-latency under prefill, not Cliff 2b. Worth flagging as a possible
"eGPU bus class" threshold allowance for soak-test.

### ⚠️ Cliffs, gotchas, regressions

- **Merge v7.69-cliff2-test: ship Cliff 2 closure recipes (Balanced MTP + Max-context)** ([15b84df](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/15b84df717d1a7b193946a1cb8de0945d7f2693d))
- **v7.69 + #35975 + Codex P103 gate fix — Cliff 2 closure recipes** ([f6613c8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f6613c869abd6260825cf3fde17956a867316d43))


Six rounds of cross-rig bisect with Codex/ChatGPT diagnosis closes
Cliff 2 at 60K on TP=1 + 24GB. Two shippable variants:

Balanced MTP (long-text.yml updated):
- Genesis v7.69 dev tip (commit 2db18df)
- Codex r1 P103 gate fix applied to nested Genesis tree (cu_seqlens=[0,T]
  treated as dense single-seq, not multi-seq varlen). Sent to Sander as
  v7.70 proposal — diff in /tmp/cliff2_v770_cu_seqlens_response.md.
- vllm#35975 backport sidecar (patch_inputs_embeds_optional.py)
- mem-util 0.93 (down from 0.95)
- max_model_len 180000 (admission ceiling at this mem-util)
- MTP K=3 retained
- 60K probe: HTTP 200 in 623s, recall correct, MTP AL=4.00

Max-context safety (long-text-no-mtp.yml — NEW):
- Same patches, but MTP off + mem-util 0.95
- max_model_len 200000 (admission unlocked by removing MTP residency)
- 60K probe: HTTP 200 in 537s, recall correct
- 90K probe: indeterminate within 25-min curl budget
- For long single-shot RAG / codebase analysis

Diagnostic chain:
1. Codex r1 identified P103 gate as too broad (cu_seqlens != None
   bypasses chunking even for single-seq [0,T] case). Applied fix.
2. T=4128 distribution showed chunked path never engages on real
   serving (vLLM's outer chunked-prefill caps T well below MAX_T).
3. Codex r2: real Cliff 2 source is residency, not gate logic.
4. PR #35975 backport (skip inputs_embeds for text-only) frees
   444 MiB at boot — necessary but not sufficient at 0.95 mem-util.
5. mem-util sweep at 0.92/0.93 with MTP+#35975 closed Cliff 2 at 60K.
6. MTP-off + 0.95 + 200K admission validated max-context variant.

Codex's P103 gate fix is semantically correct and worth shipping in
Genesis v7.70 even though it's not what closes 60K Cliff 2 on this
config (the FLA call sees T=4128 already, well below MAX_T).

- **PN30 dst-shaped temp fix: close DS conv state regression class on long-text** ([9af1a52](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9af1a5245adf6ac740b9e2baa7ac515379e158f4))


Background
----------

Sander shipped Genesis PN30 (a9977d8) to fix the `NotImplementedError` in
`vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/mamba_utils.py:get_conv_copy_spec` that
fires on DS layout + spec-decode `num_accepted_tokens > 1`. PN30 materializes
`state[src_block_id, :, offset:].contiguous()` and raw-memcpys it into
`state[dest_block_id]`.

ChatGPT/Codex CLI cross-checked the patch and identified a layout-correctness
bug: PN30's `.contiguous()` produces a compact buffer (10240×5 for our config
at offset=1), but the destination block is strided by full state_len (10240×6).
Raw-memcpy packs the compact rows into a layout where row 1+ start at the
wrong destination offset → corrupts DS conv state row strides → eventual TQ
store CUDA assert at probe 4 (multi-turn agent shape) was the surfacing point,
not the root offender.

The corrected fix lives in `collect_mamba_copy_meta`, where both source and
destination block ids are known. For DS conv offset > 0:

    tmp = state[dest_block_id].clone()
    tmp[..., :tail].copy_(state[src_block_id, ..., offset:])

Then batch-memcpy the full tmp block to `state[dest_block_id]`. Preserves DS
row stride. Reuses PN30's existing module-level temp tensor list + post-batch
stream sync + clear lifecycle (no churn there).

What this commit adds
---------------------

1. **`patch_pn30_dst_shaped_temp_fix.py`** — setup-time text-patch over the
   Genesis PN30 wiring file. Patches three sub-patches:
   - `pN30_collect_mamba_copy_meta_dst_shaped_temp` (NEW) — adds dst-shaped
     temp construction + lifecycle hookup in `collect_mamba_copy_meta`.
   - `pN30_get_conv_copy_spec_contiguous` (modified) — old compact `.contiguous()`
     fast path now fails closed with a clear error if the collect-time bypass
     is ever missed; prevents silent corruption.
   - `pN30_module_level_state` + `pN30_do_mamba_copy_block_cleanup` (unchanged)
     reused as-is.
   444 lines, idempotent via marker. Diagnosis credit: ChatGPT/Codex CLI.

2. **`scripts/setup.sh`** — invokes the PN30 patch after the Genesis checkout,
   alongside the existing PN25 register-fix sidecar. Both run automatically
   on `bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b` after every fresh setup.

3. **`docker-compose.long-text.yml`** — re-enables `VLLM_SSM_CONV_STATE_LAYOUT=DS`
   + `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN30_DS_LAYOUT_SPEC_DECODE=1`, restores `--max-model-len=180000`
   from the 145K SD-fallback. Net: +6% TPS and +35K context recovered.

4. **`scripts/verify-stress.sh`** — Cliff 2 (60K + 90K large rungs) deferred
   to probe 7 so engine death from architectural OOM doesn't cascade-fail
   probes 2-6. Probe 3 strictness relaxed: any HTTP 200 passes, since the
   bug class (Cliff 1 mech B inductor leak) surfaces as 500, not low token
   counts. The previous strict assertion was an over-applied lesson from the

- **PN25 v3: close Cliff 1 mech B (club-3090#16) on long-text via setup-time Genesis backport** ([a62ad78](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a62ad78a4e8a7ce62aec4d11ae967382b188df46))


Background
----------

Cliff 1 mech B is the inductor-compiled FFN intermediate buffer leak that
PN12 (eager-mode SiluAndMul.forward_cuda pool) doesn't reach. vLLM v0.20
with `compilation_config.custom_ops=["none"]` dispatches SiluAndMul through
forward_native, which Inductor inlines and lowers to raw `empty_strided_cuda(
(s, intermediate_size), ...)` — bypassing PN12's FFNIntermediateCache pool.

Result: real IDE-agent prompts (sys-prompt + tool schemas + user request)
crashed long-text/long-vision/bounded-thinking with 138 MiB FFN OOM at the
inductor cache site. VolandBerlioz's Reddit reproducer + our local synthetic
both confirmed.

Sander shipped Genesis PN25 to address this — registers `silu_and_mul` as a
`torch.library.custom_op` so Inductor treats it as opaque (can't inline).
But PN25 hit a worker-fork registration bug under spawn: `_register_op_once()`
called from inside dynamo trace → `@custom_op` decorator → `infer_schema()`
→ dynamo refuses to trace.

Filed Sander/genesis-vllm-patches#16 with the trace + analysis.

What this commit adds
---------------------

A setup-time backport that lets us enable PN25 NOW, before Sander's upstream
fix lands in our pinned version (or in case it doesn't transfer to TP=1).
Two parts in `patch_pn25_genesis_register_fix.py`:

1. **Genesis-side change** to `silu_and_mul_customop.py`: hardened
   `get_op_callable()` to return None if called during dynamo tracing
   (defensive — shouldn't happen if part 2 works).

2. **Wiring change** to `patch_N25_silu_inductor_safe_pool.py`: text-patches
   `vllm/model_executor/layers/activation.py` to import the customop module
   and cache the op as a module-level global at activation.py import time.
   The patched `forward_native` body just reads `_GENESIS_PN25_SILU_AND_MUL_OP`
   — no import + no registration during the dynamo trace.

Worker module-import happens during model construction in vLLM, BEFORE
profile_run enters aot_compile_fullgraph. Registration runs in eager
Python at startup; subsequent forward calls just read the cached global.

Wired into setup.sh after Genesis checkout. Idempotent via marker.

Also in this commit
-------------------

- **long-text.yml backed off 214K + 0.985 → 180K + 0.95.** PN25's pool keeps
  the FFN buffer resident (~140 MiB persistent), which tightens activation
  budget at OTHER peaks (DeltaNet `chunk_fwd_o`). 0.985 left only 26 MiB
  free at 30K probe — OOM. 0.95 frees ~480 MiB for activation comfort.

  Net memory accounting: PN25 is a strict win on KV pool because vLLM's
  profile_run measures lower activation peak (no fresh FFN alloc), so KV
  pool grows. Max concurrency at 180K: 1.07x without PN25 → 1.49x with
  PN25 + 0.95 (or 1.64x at 0.97 if we'd held it).

- **verify-stress.sh probe 3 hardened.** Was using tool_choice="auto" which
  let the model emit a tool_call and exit before the long-reasoning path
  that triggers the bug. Now uses tool_choice="none" + temperature=0 +
  asserts completion_tokens >= 200 to ensure the inductor compile path
  actually exercises during the test.

Validation on long-text 180K + 0.95 + PN25 v3
---------------------------------------------

| Probe                           | Result | Notes                            |

| 1.1 Long-ctx needle 9.8K        | ✅ PASS | activation budget safe           |
| 1.2 Long-ctx needle 29K         | ✅ PASS | activation budget safe at 30K    |
| 1.3 Long-ctx needle 60K         | ❌ FAIL | Cliff 2 architectural (DeltaNet) |

| 3  IDE-agent one-shot           | ✅ PASS | **Closed by PN25 v3** ⭐         |
| 4  Multi-turn agent             | ✅ PASS | **Closed by PN25 v3** ⭐         |
| 5  LCB-coding                   | ❌ FAIL | DS conv state (Sander #17)       |
| 6  Reasoning-heavy 8192         | ✅ PASS | pure reasoning works clean       |

The 4 failures are pre-tracked separately:
- Cliff 2 (#1.3): architectural, no fix at single-card; route to dual or llama.cpp
- 25K tool RETURN (#2): Sander shipped PN31 (`753344b`) — pending our cross-rig
- LCB-coding (#5): Sander shipped PN30 (`a9977d8`) — pending our cross-rig

Sander has since shipped PN25 fix upstream (`d92bcb3` on dev) using a
slightly different approach (hasattr check on global registry). Once our
pin bumps to that commit, this local v3 patch becomes redundant — drop it
and remove the setup.sh hook in a follow-up.

Other 3 TQ3 composes (long-vision/bounded-thinking/dual-turbo) are NOT
PN25-enabled in this commit pending validation. Long-text is the only
compose with PN25 active + verified.

- **walk back: Cliff 1 mech B reproduces on real IDE-agent prompts (club-3090#16)** ([b62b6b1](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b62b6b1de46cab098718d6f671b12480d687ab4c))


PR #23's "synthetic 50K-token tool-prefill stress passes on v0.20" finding
does NOT translate to real IDE-agent workloads. Reproduced 2026-05-01 PM:
a 5,900-char system prompt + 10 typical tool schemas + 346-char user
request + max_tokens=2000 crashes the engine on long-text / long-vision /
bounded-thinking / dual-turbo with a 98 MiB OOM at:

  inductor_cache/.../py:1208
    buf9 = empty_strided_cuda((s18, 17408), (17408, 1), torch.float16)
  torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 98.00 MiB.

Same site as VolandBerlioz's Reddit reproducer. Genesis PN12 patches the
eager `SiluAndMul.forward_cuda` but vLLM's torch.compile inductor inlines
`forward_native`, bypassing the FFNIntermediateCache pool. PN25 (the proper
compile-path opaque-op fix) is on Genesis dev but blocked by a worker-fork
registration bug that fires `torch.library.infer_schema` during dynamo
trace. Escalated to Sandermage as urgent (genesis-vllm-patches#16
escalation comment).

What changes in this commit
---------------------------

1. **docs/SINGLE_CARD.md** — restructured the "limitation to know" section
   from one cliff to two. New Cliff 1 mech B section explicitly tells
   IDE-agent users (Cline / OpenCode / Roo / Claude Code / Cursor) to
   default to tools-text.yml until PN25 lands.

2. **docs/DUAL_CARD.md** — annotated the dual.yml entry as the
   strongly-recommended path for IDE coding agents (fp8 KV avoids the
   inductor inlining bug; dual-turbo TQ3 KV is affected).

3. **docs/UPSTREAM.md** — bumped PN25 from "✅ Closed in dev tip; opt-in"
   to "🔴 Shipped on dev BUT blocked by worker-fork registration bug".
   Added new row for the DS conv state crash (genesis-vllm-patches#17,
   filed today after LCB v6 bench triggered it on every request).

4. **Compose headers** (long-text.yml / long-vision.yml /
   bounded-thinking.yml / dual-turbo.yml) — prepended a "⚠️ NOT SAFE FOR
   IDE-AGENT WORKLOADS WITH TOOL SCHEMAS" warning to the top of each
   header with the specific failure mode + workaround.

5. **scripts/verify-stress.sh** — added a third check: IDE-agent one-shot
   prompt (sys + 10 tool schemas + user request + max_tokens=2000). Catches
   the bug on a fresh boot of any affected compose. Existing checks #1
   (long-context needle) and #2 (25K-token tool RETURN prefill) didn't
   catch this — different prefill shape, different inductor compile path.
   TODO comments added for 3 more probes (multi-turn agent / LCB-coding /
   reasoning-heavy) — left for follow-up.

Public corrections
------------------

Already posted (this commit only ships the docs + script changes):
- club-3090#16 update with synthetic-prompt repro + walked-back claims
- discussion #18 reply to @lolren correcting today's earlier recommendation
  (dual.yml is the safe path for IDE agents on dual-card; was overconfident
  earlier today saying long-* variants were closed)
- Sandermage genesis-vllm-patches#16 escalation comment
- Sandermage genesis-vllm-patches#17 (new — DS conv state crash)

Why this matters
----------------

Every IDE-agent user on master who follows our published recommendations
(long-text / long-vision / bounded-thinking) and sends a request with a
tool schema in the system prompt is on a coin-flip with this bug. Our
test surface didn't catch it because canonical narrative+code prompts
don't trigger the offending inductor code path. The new verify-stress
probe will catch it on every future boot.

- **Ship verified Cliff 1 closure on long-text 205K + long-vision 192K** ([287de1c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/287de1c6e8f1500dd9144dce9a9b9fbf601d7d67))


Both compose variants now wire in the local sidecars and enable the
GENESIS_ENABLE_* env flags needed for the cliff-safe stack:

long-text.yml (205K + no vision):
  - PN12 + P104 sidecars + --num-gpu-blocks-override 50
  - verify-stress 671 chars / finish=stop, verify-full 8/8, MTP AL 2.45,
    VRAM 22.6/24 GB

long-vision.yml (192K + vision):
  - Same sidecars, no override needed (vision tower's ~1 GB pressure
    keeps auto-sized KV pool at 260K which leaves enough activation
    budget on its own)
  - verify-stress 643 chars / finish=stop, verify-full 8/8, MTP AL 2.63,
    VRAM 24/24 GB at idle (tight but proven safe for 25K tool prefill)

patch_pn12_ffn_pool_anchor.py:
  - Now idempotent. Detects Genesis-side PN12 already applied (e.g. when
    the bundled Genesis tree carries the anchor fix from PR #13) and
    exits 0 with skip-genesis-pn12-applied. Prevents set -e from killing
    the container when sidecar runs after Genesis-side has already
    pooled the file.

Cliff 2 (DeltaNet GDN forward at single-prompt >50-60K) unchanged on
both — these variants stay "steady-state accumulation across many
turns, not single-shot big prompts."

- **Cliff 1 P104 + P101 anchor fix outcomes (built on cliff1-fa-clamp branch)** ([e6570a7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e6570a7d1139c6bf61c91569f55a4844971a7ecb))


5-hour Codex agent session shipped two Genesis contributions on a local
branch (club-3090-cliff1-prep in the Genesis clone), waiting for upstream
PR submission. Empirical finding: TQ3+MTP+single-card hits an architectural
wall — Cliff 1 mechanism A (FA2 softmax_lse) closes via P104; mechanism B
(FFN intermediate buffer) is bounded by max_num_batched_tokens which is
pinned at 4128 by Mamba block_size.

P101 anchor drift discovery: P101 was silently no-op'd on dev205+ for
anyone enabling GENESIS_ENABLE_P101=1. apply_all reported "applied"
misleadingly. Fix updates anchor to match upstream torch.arange form.

P104 (new): env-gated FA max_seqlen_k runtime clamp, follows Genesis
text-patch infra, ~260 lines. PR-ready.

Empirical: 205K + 50-block-override + P101+P103+P104 still hits 138 MiB
FFN buffer with 130.5 MiB free. 175K + same stack: identical signature.
max_model_len is not the dominant variable.

No shipped config changes — default 48K + tools-text 75K stay correct.
Updates limited to documentation (CLIFFS.md, UPSTREAM.md, CHANGELOG.md).

Branch cliff1-fa-clamp NOT merged to master — waiting on user review +
upstream PR decision before merging.

- **Cliff 1 dual-mechanism: P101+P103 cross-rig test reveals FFN buffer cliff** ([573a377](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/573a377690a760f7fed29b80b7633b5526af2095))


Tested Sandermage's existing P101 (TQ continuation 64-token slicing)
+ P103 (FLA Cliff 2 chunked fwd) — both opt-in, default-OFF, never
enabled by us. Hypothesis was they'd close Cliff 1 directly.

Empirical result: they don't fully close Cliff 1. P101 reroutes
around the FA2 softmax_lse mechanism (the one ChatGPT/DeepSeek
pointed at), but Cliff 1 has a SECOND mechanism — the FFN
intermediate buffer (max_num_batched_tokens × intermediate_size
= 4128 × 17408 × 2 bytes = 138 MiB per chunk). With vision tower's
~500 MiB pressure, the FFN buffer dominates and fires Cliff 1
even with P101 active.

Three test runs (all P101+P103 enabled):
- 192K + 0.98 + vision: FFN buffer OOM (138 MiB / 130 MiB free)
- 175K + 0.97 + vision: FFN buffer OOM (138 MiB / 110 MiB free)
- 205K + 0.98 + no-vision: FA2 softmax_lse OOM (50 MiB / 50 MiB)

So the dominant Cliff 1 mechanism depends on whether vision is on.
The proposed FA2 clamp at issue #11 still useful for the tools-text
/ long-text-no-vision case but wouldn't fully unlock long-vision —
FFN buffer is downstream and architectural.

Updates:
- CLIFFS.md: revised "Root cause" section with dual mechanism, table
  of which fires under which configs, what each mitigation closes
- CHANGELOG: documented the discovery
- Posted cross-rig data to Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#11 (the
  pleasant surprise — confirms his patches work for what they do,
  identifies the second mechanism we missed)

No shipped config changes. Default 48K + tools-text 75K stay correct.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **Cliff 1 root cause revised: FA2 softmax_lse sized by max_seqlen** ([2d6b69d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2d6b69dd50eaa4764f12d6c30cc7d91c4355881b))


After bisecting long-vision config space (192K/128K/96K/86K at 0.98
and 0.92 mem-util) and second-opinion synthesis from ChatGPT +
DeepSeek + vLLM source review, the actual root cause is:

  softmax_lse in flash_attn_varlen_func is allocated as
  [num_seqs, num_heads, max_seqlen] — sized by the max_seqlen
  parameter, NOT the actual cu_seqlens.

vLLM passes attn_metadata.max_seq_len; during cudagraph capture
that's set to max_model_len. So a 25K-token tool prefill at
max-model-len=192K allocates softmax_lse for 192K, eating the
activation headroom. The 50-138 MiB OOMs we'd been observing
are downstream of this leak.

Empirical OOM site (verified in our docker logs): _vllm_fa2_C.varlen_fwd
in flash_attn_varlen_func. Upstream root cause: Dao-AILab/flash-
attention#1011 (open since 2024). vLLM cap-leak path: vllm#40961.

Earlier "FFN intermediate buffer" characterization was wrong.

Updates:
- UPSTREAM.md: new FA2 section (Dao-AILab/flash-attention#1011);
  added vllm#40961 (cudagraph capture max_seq_len pattern), vllm#40069
  (TurboQuant follow-ups tracker), and vllm#25543 (V0 deprecation
  removed max_seq_len_to_capture, so commonly-suggested mitigation
  doesn't apply on V1 nightly)
- FAQ.md: corrected Cliff 1 explanation
- SINGLE_CARD.md: corrected "Cliff 1 still fires" caveat
- CHANGELOG: documented bisection + revision
- memory/qwen36_27b_prefill_cliffs.md: revised Cliff 1 mechanism;
  noted Cliff 2 likely shares the same architectural pattern

Practical implication: no new variant ships. Default 48K + 0.92 +
TQ3 + vision stays the prefill-safe ceiling — pushing higher requires
upstream fix at FA repo, not config tuning. tools-text.yml (75K + FP8
+ PN8 closes Cliff 1) remains the IDE-agent path.

### ✨ Features

- **feat(preflight): compose-dependency + HF_TOKEN + KV-format checks (#37, #47, #219)** ([b6c8708](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b6c870820978fe641771e631700e11e17bf475d2))


Closes the UX gap raised by @snoby on #37 — previously, launching a
compose that needs the DFlash draft model without first running
WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1 setup.sh would fail with vLLM's generic
"Invalid repository ID or local directory" pydantic error.

Adds three new preflight functions in scripts/preflight.sh:

1. preflight_hf_token (soft warn) — wired into setup.sh before the model
   download. Catches missing HF_TOKEN early and tells the user exactly
   what to do (visit hf.co/settings/tokens, accept T&C, export the token).
   Skip via PREFLIGHT_NO_HF_TOKEN=1.

2. preflight_compose_deps (hard error) — wired into switch.sh just before
   docker compose up. Parses the target compose YAML for known model-path
   patterns (qwen3.6-27b-dflash, qwen3.6-27b-mtp-head, qwen3.6-27b-autoround-int4)
   and verifies each exists on host. If missing, emits a clear "Fix:" line
   with the exact setup.sh invocation needed (e.g. WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1).
   Refuses to proceed with exit 1. Skip via PREFLIGHT_NO_COMPOSE_DEPS=1.

3. preflight_kv_format_hint (soft warn) — wired into switch.sh as the last
   pre-up check. Detects smallest VRAM via nvidia-smi; if <24 GB and the
   target compose uses turboquant_3bit_nc KV, emits the @efschu finding
   from #47 (TQ3 → fp8_e5m2 swap rule) with cross-link to docs/HARDWARE.md
   + a tools/kv-calc.py one-liner to predict the user's specific config.
   Skip via PREFLIGHT_NO_KV_HINT=1.

Tested on this rig:
- HF_TOKEN unset → warns
- Missing DFlash dir → hard errors with WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1 hint
- Missing main model → hard errors with generic setup.sh hint
- 24 GB rig + TQ3 compose → silent (correct, TQ3 is right pick)
- Simulated 20 GB rig + TQ3 compose → fires the fp8_e5m2 hint

All preflights are individually skippable via PREFLIGHT_NO_<NAME>=1
env vars (matches existing PREFLIGHT_NO_FETCH=1 / PREFLIGHT_NO_GENESIS_PIN=1
patterns).

- **feat(tools): kv-calc.py — predict per-card VRAM budget for Qwen3.6-27B (#226)** ([4e89c6a](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/4e89c6aa40856126ab5803159ad69211a03a1a9a))


A directional estimator for "will this compose fit on my hardware?" that
runs before boot. Useful for:
- Comparative analysis (TQ3 vs fp8 KV trade-off, TP=1 vs TP=2 budget)
- Max-ctx solver (binary search the largest max_ctx that fits given
  vram/tp/kv_format/max_num_seqs/mem_util)
- Educational breakdown (weights / KV pool / activation peak / cudagraph
  workspace per-card components)

Anchored to published literature where applicable:
- PerfMamba (arxiv 2511.22849) — O(γ·D·N·L) scaling for the GDN forward
  intermediate (this is our Cliff 2 mechanism)
- TurboQuant (arxiv 2504.19874, ICLR 2026) — TQ3 byte savings
- PagedAttention (arxiv 2309.06180) — KV pool layout

Calibrated empirically against BENCHMARKS.md cross-rig data. Current
verdict accuracy: 9/11 shipped composes (82%) with ±1.5 GB error band.
The two miscalibrations are over-predictions on max_num_seqs > 1
configs; vLLM's actual KV pool allocation rate-limits internally in
ways my naive demand formula doesn't capture. Documented as a known
limitation in docs/KV_MATH.md.

Usage examples:
  bash tools/kv-calc.py --compose dual-turbo --vram 20 --mem-util 0.82
  bash tools/kv-calc.py --solve-max-ctx --tp 2 --kv-format fp8_e5m2 --vram 16
  bash tools/kv-calc.py --calibration

Documents the math at docs/KV_MATH.md including:
- Per-component formulas (weights / KV pool / activation peak / overhead)
- Per-KV-format byte tables
- The TQ3→fp8 swap rule on 20 GB cards (validated by @efschu, #47)
- Known limitations + when to trust kv-calc.py vs vLLM's boot log

Closes #226 (the v1 calculator). Future work that's NOT in this commit:
multi-model support (DeepSeek-V3, GLM-4.5 — requires per-architecture
spec tables), driver-class overhead modeling (4090 vs 3090 deltas
beyond what we currently fold into the ±1.5 GB error band), Cliff 2b
fragmentation modeling.

- **feat(bounded-thinking): Phase 3 grammar A/B complete; DeepSeek scratchpad is the new recommended grammar** ([b956c85](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b956c85477f0f4e9dd00e20c0dfc68bc30ad20b4))


After the full Phase 3 5-grammar A/B (HE+ 164 + LCB v6 50, n=214 problems
× 5 conditions = 1070 generations), bounded-thinking.yml is updated to
recommend the DeepSeek scratchpad grammar (PLAN/NOTE×0-15/VERDICT FSM at
tools/grammar-eval/deepseek-scratchpad.gbnf) as the default.

Phase 3 results (combined HE+ + LCB v6, all FSM-enforced):
- DeepSeek scratchpad:       87.4% Pass@1 (+1 net vs andthattoo, +4pp on LCB)
- andthattoo G/A/E:          86.9% (the originally-published technique)
- Holiday tagline:           86.4%
- PROMPT_TERSE (no FSM):     82.2% (Phase 2's n=30 win was subset-selection bias)
- FREE (no constraint):      78.0% (baseline)

Phase 1 reproducibility is exact: HE+ FSM Δ +4.3pp / LCB v6 Δ +24.0pp,
both match Phase 1's published numbers — validates the bench harness.

Compose ships unchanged engine-side (same vLLM image, same Genesis stack,
same TQ3 KV, same MTP n=3, same enable_in_reasoning flag). Only the
docstring's recommended-grammar pointer + the on-disk grammar files in
tools/grammar-eval/ change. Three grammars are now validated and available
client-side via extra_body={"structured_outputs": {"grammar": ...}}:

  - DeepSeek scratchpad (default, best LCB)
  - andthattoo G/A/E (originally-published, ~4× tighter think budget)
  - Holiday tagline (extreme 24-token compression, wins LCB by 4pp too)

Combined-accuracy spread is within noise (0.5pp at n=214), so we ship one
compose rather than three siblings — choice is at the client, not at the
compose level.

Bug fix bundled: tools/grammar-eval/subset-bench.py --full --include-lcb
mode now correctly threads dataset kind through run_condition so LCB
problems use mod.run_tests_livecodebench instead of HE+ assertion-based
testing. Without this, the Phase 3 LCB shard crashed with KeyError:
'prompt' on the HE→LCB transition.

This wraps active research on bounded-thinking. Reopen if upstream FSM-
regress cluster behavior changes (Genesis pin bump, vLLM grammar engine
swap, model-family change), or if user demand surfaces for a sibling
compose pinning a non-default grammar.

- **feat(report.sh): --stress + --soak flags, --full now the canonical "everything" pass** ([8a29b95](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/8a29b95da10f7ab45151fba866aa526f2a1796c2))


scripts/report.sh now has four optional sections:
  --verify    verify-full.sh    (~1-2 min)
  --stress    verify-stress.sh  (~5-10 min, 7/7 incl. Cliff 2 needles)
  --soak      SOAK_MODE=continuous + summary.md embed (~25 min, catches Cliff 2b)
  --bench     bench.sh          (~3 min, canonical TPS)
  --full      all four          (~35 min total, the canonical cross-rig pass)

Why soak as its own flag: verify-full + verify-stress + bench all PASS on
configs that FAIL the multi-turn continuous soak (Cliff 2b at ~25K accumulated
tokens). Until upstream lands a fix, soak is the only test that catches the
agentic-workload failure mode that bit issues #41 / #42 / #43 / #45.

Propagated --full as the recommended single-command path through:
- README.md (bug/bench callout)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (Numbers from your rig + new compose variant gate)
- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md (one checkbox covers verify+stress+soak+bench)
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/numbers-from-your-rig.yml (single paste includes soak)
- BENCHMARKS.md ("How to add a row for your rig")

Backward compatible: existing --verify and --bench flags unchanged.

- **feat(qwen3.6-27b/vllm): add dual4 + dual4-dflash composes (TP=4, 4×3090, #44)** ([#44](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/44) by @Whamp)


First 4-card variants for Qwen3.6-27B vLLM. Two new composes for 4× RTX 3090 PCIe rigs:

- `docker-compose.dual4.yml` — TP=4 fp8/MTP baseline. 63 narr / 76 code TPS, 6.77× concurrency at 262K, ~23.5 GB/card peak
- `docker-compose.dual4-dflash.yml` — TP=4 + DFlash spec-decode. 64 narr / 104 code TPS, 2.27× concurrency at 262K, ~22 GB/card peak

Both pass verify-full + verify-stress 7/7 (incl. Cliff 2 needle recall at 58K + 91K) on @Whamp's 4× RTX 3090 PCIe rig. Both pass v2 continuous soak (dual4: 20 sessions, 0 MiB growth, 90.8% TPS retention; dual4-dflash: 5 sessions, 0 MiB growth, 100% TPS retention) — first cross-rig confirmation that TP=4 escapes Cliff 2b.

Closes #26 (4×3090 wishlist).

- **feat(grammar-eval): land harness for Holiday tagline grammar A/B** ([7be8ecc](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7be8ecc9e0977ae2d27397811a1cbb24b51b4b68))


Codex-implemented harness from docs/diagnostics/grammar-eval-codex-brief.md
(gitignored). Sets up the A/B test of Holiday_Purpose_3166's tagline
grammar (Reddit r/LocalLLaMA 1sx7w55) against our shipped
andthattoo/structured-cot GOAL/APPROACH/EDGE grammar.

The hypothesis: Holiday's K/R free-token-list fields are a pressure-relief
valve that GOAL/APPROACH/EDGE's rigid 3-line shape lacks. We have 6
documented HE+ regression cases (HE/97, 101, 108, 129, 137, 151) where
FSM under-thinks and FREE wins; if Holiday's grammar rescues some
without losing too much compression, it's a Pareto improvement worth
shipping.

Files:
  - tools/grammar-eval/holiday-tagline.gbnf — translated grammar
    (Holiday's bounded-repetition `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_.!-]{0,18}` rewritten
    as explicit nullable tail rules for xgrammar compatibility; opening
    `<think>\n  ` removed since Qwen3.6 chat template prefixes it; closing
    `</think>\n  \n  ` preserved verbatim).
  - tools/grammar-eval/TRANSLATION.md — translation decisions + Phase-1
    smoke results (5/5 tagline prompts PASS shape regex against
    vllm/bounded-thinking; FREE failures are existing max_tokens trap, not
    grammar issues).
  - tools/grammar-eval/smoke-test.py — Phase-1 runner. Validates grammar
    parses + applies on vLLM/xgrammar before committing compute to bench.
  - tools/grammar-eval/subset-bench.py — Phase-2 30-prompt HE+ A/B harness
    (6 FSM-regress + 4 FREE-regress + 20 random; runs FREE / current /
    Holiday / PROMPT_TERSE; outputs results.jsonl + summary.md).
  - tools/grammar-eval/README.md — overview + run instructions.

docs/STRUCTURED_COT.md — extended "FSM-regress cases are real" section
with note on this active experiment, scope, and gating decision (≥3 of
6 rescues = phase 3; 0-2 rescues = drop).

Phase-1 smoke validation cross-rig (this rig, 2026-05-03 PM):
  vllm/bounded-thinking + Qwen3.6-27B AutoRound INT4 + vLLM
  0.20.1rc1.dev16 + Genesis 2db18df/v7.69. All 5 tagline prompts return
  successfully + match BODY_RE regex. Translation is valid xgrammar
  syntax; ready for phase-2 bench whenever compute is available.

Phase 2/3 deferred — bench takes ~30-60 min (subset) / ~6-8h (full HE+ +
LCB v6). User asked to ship harness now and run bench later.

- **feat(soak-test): continuous-mode v2 fixtures + reproduces Cliff 2 at 25K accumulated context** ([8d5bfd8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/8d5bfd85f99a6a7c2c91cf70241c1e46c56ae957))


Adds SOAK_MODE=continuous env knob to scripts/soak-test.sh for testing
context-accumulation accretion. Each session becomes a single multi-turn
agentic-coding conversation (system → tool_call → tool_result → ... ×5)
that ramps to ~22-25K accumulated context by turn 5 — the workload shape
that bit GuiPerPT in club-3090#41 but that v1 fresh-mode fixtures couldn't
reproduce.

scripts/soak-helper.py — continuous-mode primitives:
  - CONTINUOUS_TURNS — 5 ramping turn specs (350 → 1500 max_tokens, with
    tool_synth describing the synthetic filler the next turn injects)
  - _filler_python_code / _filler_grep_output / _filler_command_output —
    plausible synthetic content of configurable size so context grows
    even when the model doesn't emit a real tool_call
  - cmd_init_session — creates state file with system prompt
  - cmd_request_continuous — appends new user message to state, generates
    request body using accumulated history
  - cmd_ingest — appends assistant response + synthetic tool result to
    state. Falls back to synthesized assistant tool_call when the model
    didn't emit one (so context still grows as designed).
  - cmd_run extended to accumulate streamed content / reasoning_content /
    tool_calls deltas (was metrics-only in v1) so cmd_ingest can re-use them.

scripts/soak-test.sh — gated branching:
  - SOAK_MODE env (fresh|continuous, default: fresh — v1 backward compat)
  - Continuous mode requires SOAK_TURNS=5 (turn shapes are a designed ramp;
    partial sessions don't reach target ctx). Validated upfront with hard
    error if mismatch.
  - Per-session state file at results/<run>/states/state-s{N}.json
  - Inserts init-session at start of each session; request-continuous +
    ingest around each turn's HTTP call.

CROSS-RIG VALIDATION (this rig, RTX 3090, today):

  Config                          Boot     Max VRAM   Growth    OOM at
  vllm/long-vision 145K + 0.95   21778    23818      +2040 MiB s1 t5 (~26K)
  vllm/long-text 180K + 0.93     22434    23736      +3240 MiB s1 t4 (~21K)

Both crash with byte-identical stack trace to GuiPerPT's #41 report:
  chunk_gated_delta_rule → chunk_fwd_o → torch.empty_like(v)
  → CUDA OOM, tried 38-50 MiB, ~32 MiB free.

Major finding: Cliff 2 fires at ~21-26K *accumulated* context, not just at
50-60K *single* prompts. Both shipping single-card variants are unsafe
under multi-turn agent traffic. Updates to FAQ + per-model docs pending —
this commit ships the diagnostic primitive that exposed the finding.
Practical impact for users to be communicated separately.

Mock-tested all helper commands end-to-end before live runs:
  - init-session → 1 msg (system)
  - request-continuous turn 1 → 2 msgs, ~1.9K bytes
  - ingest turn 1 → 4 msgs, 22K bytes (filler injected)
  - ... ramp through turn 5 → 15 msgs, 106K bytes (~26K toks)
  - fallback synthesis verified when model returns empty tool_calls

- **feat(scripts): add soak-test.sh — runtime VRAM accretion validation (closes gap from #41)** ([563a39e](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/563a39e0d3e7acbc15bb3c743d81cdcbef442dd4))


Implements docs/diagnostics/soak-test-codex-brief.md (Codex). Fills the
gap exposed by club-3090#41 where a config passes verify-full + verify-stress
but accretes VRAM under realistic multi-turn agent traffic and OOMs
mid-session. The third validation primitive completes the trio:

  verify-full.sh    — boots correctly?
  verify-stress.sh  — known cliffs fire under one-shot stress?
  soak-test.sh      — runtime accretion under multi-turn traffic? (NEW)

scripts/soak-test.sh (195 LOC bash entrypoint):
  - Auto-detects container (vllm-qwen36-27b*) + endpoint (mapped port)
  - Runs SOAK_SESSIONS=20 × SOAK_TURNS=5 sessions (~10-30 min)
  - Warm baseline captured AFTER first completed turn (post torch.compile +
    cudagraph capture stabilization)
  - Per-turn nvidia-smi snapshot, docker stats baseline + final
  - Fails on: engine-dead errors, VRAM growth > SOAK_MAX_GROWTH_MIB (200 MiB),
    decode-TPS retention < 80%, or wall-clock > SOAK_TIMEOUT_S (1800s)
  - Read-only against deployment; not invoked from launch.sh (opt-in)

scripts/soak-helper.py (432 LOC Python helper):
  - 5 fixture shapes: small chat → tool-call inspection → 12K-char tool
    result paste → parse_size code completion → reasoning-heavy thinking
    problem. Realistic OpenAI-tool-format requests (3 tools: read_file,
    grep, run_command).
  - SSE stream parser captures TTFT (first content/reasoning_content/tool_calls
    delta) + completion_tokens from usage chunk
  - cmd_summary computes: p50/p95 TPS + TTFT, first-5/last-5 retention,
    VRAM oscillation, slow-turn count. Emits markdown summary + exits
    0/1/2 (pass/fail/inconclusive).

Validation done locally without live stack (Codex did not boot a vLLM
container):
  - bash -n + py_compile both clean
  - All 5 fixture shapes generate valid OpenAI-compat JSON requests
  - PASS path: clean turn-log → exit 0
  - FAIL paths: VRAM growth > threshold, engine-dead 500, TPS retention
    < 80% — all correctly produce exit 1
  - GuiPerPT #41 replay: synthetic 1.2 GiB growth across 20 sessions
    correctly produces FAIL: "VRAM grew 1165 MiB > 200 MiB threshold"

Live cross-rig validation pending — recommended next:
  CONTAINER=vllm-qwen36-27b-long-vision bash scripts/soak-test.sh
  (expected: FAIL on the #41-style 0.95 mem-util config, validating that
  the test discriminates correctly)
  CONTAINER=vllm-qwen36-27b-long-text bash scripts/soak-test.sh
  (expected: PASS on the known-good 0.93 baseline)

- **feat: detect repo drift in preflight + add scripts/update.sh** ([43fe2a4](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/43fe2a4e20ac8eb5c3f406f25ca0588a0989fb21))


Two-part addition for the most common stale-setup pattern: user cloned
weeks ago, master has moved (Genesis pin bumps, compose changes, vendored
patch updates), they re-run their compose, hit a stale config, and file
an issue we already solved on master. Wispborne's _register_op_once and
GuiPerPT's pre-pull boot OOM both surfaced through this loop.

scripts/preflight.sh — preflight_repo_drift:
  - Skips silently if not a git repo, on a non-master branch, or if
    PREFLIGHT_NO_FETCH=1 (offline rigs / CI / forks tracking elsewhere).
  - Verifies origin remote is noonghunna/club-3090 (avoids false positives
    on forks pointing elsewhere).
  - timeout 5 git fetch --quiet origin master — bounded so flaky networks
    don't block boot.
  - On behind > 0: WARN with commit count, last-fetch age (h/d), and the
    one-line fix command. Soft-warning, never blocks. Tells user about
    PREFLIGHT_NO_FETCH=1 for opting out.

Wired into both launch.sh and switch.sh, alongside the existing
preflight_genesis_pin so users get one consolidated stale-setup signal.

scripts/update.sh — the easy upgrade path:
  - Refuses on dirty tree (git status --porcelain) — surfaces the local
    edits and tells the user to commit or stash first. We don't clobber
    the rare user who's been editing a compose locally.
  - Refuses on non-master branch — feature branches and fork-trackers
    should pull manually; this script is the master-from-origin path.
  - git pull --ff-only — no merge commits, no rebase ambiguity. Diverged
    branches get an explicit error pointing at git pull --rebase.
  - Re-runs setup.sh (idempotent — re-pins Genesis, re-vendors Marlin).
  - Tells the user to restart their variant via switch.sh — doesn't auto-
    restart, so they can A/B old-vs-new if they want.
  - --dry-run shows the plan without changing anything.
  - --force re-runs setup.sh even when up-to-date (for "I edited Genesis
    by hand and want it re-pinned" cases).

Why detection-then-explicit-command instead of "press y to auto-update":
the user will rarely have local commits (they're consumers of the recipes,
not vLLM contributors), but we still want consent — they should see what
they're committing to. The dirty-tree guard handles the rare custom-edit
case without nagging the common path.

- **feat(launch/switch): register vllm/dual-nvlink as a known variant** ([75de7c9](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/75de7c95dbcbc0c2c87f8130960340d204956224))


Wires JusefPol's NVLink compose into the same machinery the rest of the
variants use:

  - switch.sh — adds vllm/dual-nvlink to the usage doc, VARIANT_DEFAULT_PORT
    (8014, matches the compose's PORT fallback), and the VARIANTS map. Now
    'bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual-nvlink' works the same way 'vllm/dual'
    does.
  - launch.sh — adds the variant to LAUNCH_DEFAULT_PORT + LAUNCH_DEFAULT_CONTAINER
    so 'bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/dual-nvlink' resolves the
    endpoint URL + container name correctly for post-launch verify.

Intentionally NOT added to the launch.sh interactive wizard's dual-card menu
(line 169). The wizard runs on every fresh setup, and offering an NVLink
option to a PCIe-only user would silently boot a config that crashes on
their topology. Users with NVLink can invoke explicitly via --variant.

- **feat(preflight): warn when Genesis tree out of sync with setup.sh's declared pin** ([d552ed9](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d552ed92166a07ce5fc3c289d9b42745f8479da5))


Catches the failure mode @wispborne hit in #32: user pulled latest
club-3090 (which bumped GENESIS_PIN in scripts/setup.sh from old →
new), but didn't re-run setup.sh. The on-disk Genesis tree at
models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/genesis/ stays at the OLD pin while
setup.sh's declared pin advances. vLLM boots against the outdated
tree and hits mysterious patch failures (e.g. v7.66 PN25's
infer_schema crash that v7.69 PN25 worker-spawn registration fixed).

Adds new `preflight_genesis_pin` function to scripts/preflight.sh:

- Parses `GENESIS_PIN="${GENESIS_PIN:-<default>}"` from setup.sh to
  extract the declared default value
- Reads on-disk HEAD via `git -C <genesis-dir> rev-parse --short HEAD`
- Compares (declared short-form vs on-disk short-form match)
- On mismatch: emits a [preflight] WARN block with both pins + a
  "Fix: bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b" hint
- Soft-warning only — does not block boot

Wired into both entry points:
- scripts/launch.sh (the wizard-driven path) — adds the check after
  preflight_running, before the variant pick
- scripts/switch.sh (the direct stateless switcher) — adds the check
  inside up_variant() right before the docker compose up call

Skips silently if the Genesis tree hasn't been cloned yet (caller
should run setup.sh first; preflight isn't the place to handle that
case). Also skips if setup.sh isn't present at the expected path
(weird state — silent skip rather than false warnings).

Tested locally:
- Current state (declared 2db18df = on-disk 2db18df): silent ✓
- bash -n passes on all three modified scripts

Coverage gap: users who bypass switch.sh + launch.sh and run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.X.yml up -d` directly won't get
the warning. That's the canonical-path-vs-bypass tradeoff; we lead
with switch.sh in the docs.

Closes the procedural follow-up flagged in
[#32 comment-4364895764](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/32#issuecomment-4364895764)
("setup.sh should be re-run after every git pull that bumps
GENESIS_PIN. We could add a check for this — compare setup.sh's
declared pin vs the on-disk tree's HEAD, warn if they differ.").

- **feat(scripts/report.sh): capture per-GPU PCIe lane width + Gen + bus ID** ([535be29](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/535be29df4520095bdb07cfe093031ca076f65b2))


The topology matrix from `nvidia-smi topo -m` shows how cards are
connected to each other (PHB, PXB, NV#, etc.) but not each card's
effective host bandwidth. PCIe lane width matters for:

- Single-card model load speed (17.69 GB checkpoint over PCIe)
- Per-card all-reduce bandwidth on TP=2+ NCCL paths
- Riser-cable rigs (mining frames at x1, splitter cards at x4)
- Asymmetric consumer mobos (one slot CPU x16, another chipset x4)
- BIOS bifurcation misconfigurations

Adds per-GPU PCIe line via `nvidia-smi --query-gpu`:

  - **PCIe:** x16 lanes negotiated (GPU max x16, Gen up to 4) | bus 0000:01:00.0

Flags `⚠ slot is narrower than GPU capability` when current width is
below the GPU's max lane count — strong signal that the slot/riser is
the bottleneck.

Important non-flag: `pcie.link.gen.current` drops to Gen 1 at idle for
power saving on NVIDIA cards. Initial test showed our local rig
reporting "Gen 1" at idle — false positive if we flagged that. Width
is hardware-fixed and is the reliable signal; gen flagging removed.
Comment in script explains this for future maintainers.

Worked example: a 4090 in a chipset-routed PCIe Gen 4 x4 slot would
show `x4 lanes negotiated (GPU max x16) ⚠` — instant diagnosis when
multi-card aggregate throughput is below expectations.

- **feat(scripts/report.sh): capture container-internal Python/CUDA versions** ([e491e07](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e491e07972275e2155421182a7f2df830170cd21))


Adds a new "Container Python / CUDA versions" sub-section to the active
container block, surfacing what the container actually sees vs the host
nvidia-smi numbers we already capture.

New fields per container (single docker exec, ~1-2 sec):
- PyTorch version + CUDA build version + cuDNN version
  (e.g. `torch=2.11.0+cu130 torch_cuda_build=13.0 cudnn=91900`)
- vLLM version (validates the pinned image SHA matches what's running)
- nvidia-smi from inside the container (confirms NVIDIA Container Toolkit
  is wiring through correctly — driver version inside container should
  match host)

The host-vs-container CUDA version mismatch is the rare failure mode
that image SHA pinning alone doesn't catch: image is correct, host driver
is correct, but PyTorch was built against a different CUDA. This makes
that visible at-a-glance instead of requiring `docker exec` archaeology
during triage.

Graceful fallback if `docker exec` fails (container unhealthy, python3
not in PATH, torch/vllm not importable) — section just notes the failure
and moves on rather than aborting the whole report.

Tested locally on running long-text container: PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130
shipped in vLLM image vs host CUDA 13.2 — version surface working as
designed.

- **feat(scripts): add report.sh — paste-ready triage report** ([31982f0](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/31982f0e6b029498b7244273217d448250aeeb20))


One-pass diagnostic dump for users to attach to bug reports, share on
discussion threads when contributing benchmark data, or include in
issue templates. Replaces the back-and-forth of asking each user
individually for nvidia-smi / commit SHA / GENESIS_PIN / docker logs /
container state.

Captures (default, ~2 sec):
- System: OS, kernel, WSL/VM detection, locale, uptime
- CPU + RAM: model, threads, total, available, swap
- Disk: MODEL_DIR + Docker root + filesystem types + free space
- GPU hardware: model, VRAM, driver, VBIOS, persistence, CUDA, ECC,
  power limit + default + max + draw with ⚠ flag if user-capped,
  NVLink topology + status, full nvidia-smi (collapsed)
- Display state: $DISPLAY, X/Wayland processes, idle VRAM per GPU
  with ⚠ if a serving GPU is holding non-zero VRAM
- Container runtime: Docker, compose v2, NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- Stack version: club-3090 commit + branch + dirty-tree warning,
  GENESIS_PIN default + env override, cached vLLM image SHAs
- Active container: name, status, ports, image, Genesis Results banner,
  local sidecar application status, KV pool sizing, full engine config
  (CLI flags + speculative_config), warnings/errors, full boot log
  (collapsed)

Optional flags:
- --verify  adds verify-full.sh output (~1-2 min)
- --bench   adds canonical TPS bench (~3 min)
- --full    both
- --no-redact disable path/host/user/HF token redaction
- --container NAME override container auto-detection

By default, paths under user homes, hostnames, usernames, HF tokens,
and hf_ prefixes are redacted to avoid leaking PII when users paste
into public issues/discussions.

Output: structured markdown with <details> collapsibles for noisy
sections (full nvidia-smi, full boot log, verify, bench). Issue
threads stay readable.

Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 + 2× RTX 3090 PCIe + Docker 29.4.1 with both
no-container and running-container scenarios.

- **push long-text/bounded-thinking back to 185K + 0.975; long-vision stays 140K + 0.95** ([df91d64](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/df91d641c443e1dd308cde8cc06175655dcfcd8e))


After 383b5cc shipped 175K + 0.97 (text) and 140K + 0.95 (vision),
audit showed the cliffs the backoff was protecting against fire on
every config we ship — they're independent of max-model-len. So the
context capacity was wasted protection.

Push text-only ceilings up:
  long-text:        175K + 0.97  → 185K + 0.975
  bounded-thinking: 175K + 0.97  → 185K + 0.975

Vision stays at 140K + 0.95: tried 185K + 0.98, 185K + 0.975, 160K
+ 0.97; all reopened Cliff 2 (DeltaNet GDN forward buffer) at the
130K-char stress class. Vision tower's ~1 GiB persistent + the new
patches' persistent allocations (P38 K_full/V_full ~750 MiB at 185K
+ compile-safe sidecar ~138 MiB) leave too little headroom for the
GDN intermediate buffer at 30K+ token prefills on this variant.
P37 disabled on vision (was on for parity with long-text but P37's
MoE intermediate cache pool is no-op on dense Qwen3.6-27B and the

- **feat(vllm): structured-CoT bounded-thinking compose (cross-rig port)** ([3d151b9](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3d151b9edc2621cfa45a7f38f8f5c05962fe924e))


Port andthattoo/structured-cot to our stack — Qwen3.6-27B AutoRound INT4
dense / 1× RTX 3090 / vLLM nightly + MTP n=3 + TQ3 KV. Re-benched on
full HumanEval+ 164 + LiveCodeBench v6 50.

Headline (max_tokens=4096, greedy):
- HumanEval+ 164:  FSM 92.7% vs FREE 88.4% (+4.3pp), 30.7× compression
- LiveCodeBench v6 50: FSM 66.0% vs FREE 42.0% (+24pp), 26.2× compression

The +Δpp partly reflects FSM dodging the max_tokens=4096 truncation trap
rather than pure reasoning gain — see docs/STRUCTURED_COT.md "Honest
caveats" for the full picture.

Three port surprises worth keeping (all in docs):
1. vLLM dev205+ defaults StructuredOutputsConfig.enable_in_reasoning=False;
   grammar mask only fires post-</think> unless overridden.
2. Legacy extra_body={"guided_grammar": ...} is silently dropped on
   dev205+ (tip-off: identical FREE/FSM token counts). Use the new
   structured_outputs.grammar field.
3. Qwen3.6 chat template auto-prefixes <think>\n  ; drop the leading
   literal from upstream grammars when porting.

Files added:
- models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/docker-compose.bounded-thinking.yml
- docs/STRUCTURED_COT.md (public writeup)
- models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/diagnostics/structured-cot-bench.md (internal)

Files updated:
- scripts/launch.sh wizard + scripts/switch.sh variant map
- models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md (recommended single-card list, patch surface)
- models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/README.md (compose menu)
- docs/SINGLE_CARD.md (TL;DR table now four rows)
- CHANGELOG.md (new top entry)

Also reverts the long-text.yml experimental flag added during smoke
testing (the flag now lives only in bounded-thinking.yml) and adds the
Genesis pre-flight check we previously skipped on long-text.

Credit: andthattoo for the technique, the grammar files, and the eval
harness.

- **Push verified ceilings: long-text 218K, long-vision 198K** ([f3e5b52](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f3e5b5217c93d1476062caf5c94c1bfe93029dba))


Bisected new ceilings now that anchor-fixed PN12 actually pools FFN
intermediates. Findings:

long-text.yml: 205K → 218K (+6%)
  - 0.98 mem-util engine ceiling = 206K (just verified vs prior 205K).
  - Bumping to 0.985 raises engine ceiling to 218K (vLLM-reported 218784).
  - At 218K + 0.985 + no vision + no override: verify-stress + verify-full
    all pass, MTP AL 2.66, VRAM 23.7/24 GB.
  - Dropped --num-gpu-blocks-override 50 — no longer needed at 0.985 because
    the anchor-fixed PN12 cuts allocator churn enough that the natural
    activation budget at this mem-util is sufficient.

long-vision.yml: 192K → 198K (+3%)
  - 0.98 mem-util engine ceiling = 198K (vLLM-reported 198144).
  - 0.985 + vision REOPENS Cliff 1 — more goes to KV at the expense of
    activation budget, and the vision tower's persistent ~1 GB allocation
    leaves no room to absorb the change. So 0.98 stays the right balance
    for the vision variant.
  - At 198K + 0.98 + vision + sidecars: verify-stress passes.

0.99 mem-util ruled out — driver/system reserves ~440 MiB on this hardware
(23.56 GiB visible to vLLM out of 24 GB), so vLLM's startup memory check
fails at 0.99. 0.985 is the practical max.

- **Verify 256K single-prompt prefill on dual.yml (Sandermage cross-rig)** ([5270d94](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/5270d9400adfa07687ebd1beaa24cb812b10f1ea))


Sandermage claimed 262K single-prompt prefill at ~843 tok/s on his 2×
A5000. Confirmed on our 2× 3090: 237K prompt @ 284s (~834 tok/s),
peak 23.5 GB / card, finish_reason=stop, no OOM. Same SM 8.6 chip
class, throughput within 1%, as expected.

Cliff 2 (DeltaNet GDN forward OOM, fires on single-card at 50-60K)
does NOT fire on dual TP=2 — activation memory splits across cards.

UPSTREAM.md row updated to reflect verified status; DUAL_CARD.md
"long single prompts" row gets the actual measurement.

### 🎯 New models + serving paths

- **composes: formalize Status enum + Caveats field (100% coverage)** ([e1137d6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e1137d6889bbb6c7d7ddb584c942488f654c3b86))


The previous "Status optional, only when not production" convention
left readers guessing whether absence-of-status meant "validated
production" or "author forgot to fill it in." Making Status required +
enumerated removes that ambiguity.

Schema enhancement (codified in AGENTS.md):
- Status: now REQUIRED, exactly one of:
    ✅ Production              — verify-full + stress + bench + soak PASS
    ⚠️ Production w/ caveats   — works under documented constraints
    🧪 Experimental             — under active validation
    👁️ Preview                  — known quality issues, not production
    ⏸️ Upstream-gated           — blocked by external action (PR/driver)
    🗑️ Deprecated               — kept for historical reference
- Caveats: REQUIRED if Status is ⚠️/👁️/⏸️/🗑️, OMITTED for ✅/🧪.
  Single-line summary or short bullet list with issue/PR links.

Status applied to all 27 composes (vLLM + llama-cpp, all topologies):
  ✅ Production:              20  (canonical Qwen + Gemma + llama.cpp + gemma-awq)
  ⚠️ Production w/ caveats:    4  (long-text*, long-vision, carnice-bf16mtp)
  ⏸️ Upstream-gated:           2  (gemma single boot-OOM, gemma dflash-int8 needs #42102)
  👁️ Preview:                  1  (qwopus-bf16mtp)
  🧪 Experimental:             0
  🗑️ Deprecated:               0

llama-cpp composes also gained `Genesis: N/A — llama.cpp engine` for
parity with the vLLM schema (Genesis is Qwen3-Next-specific and
vLLM-only; explicit N/A prevents future readers from looking for
patches that don't exist).

- **composes: rename dual4 → multi4 to align topology prefix with MULTI_CARD.md framing** ([d33e6f8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d33e6f82da84e3e402bd2f1e0904c56cbcdb656a))


Documentation distinguishes 1 / 2 / 3+ GPUs as `single` / `dual` /
`multi`, with separate doc pages (SINGLE_CARD.md, DUAL_CARD.md,
MULTI_CARD.md). Compose filename topology prefix should match.

`dual4.yml` was an awkward outlier — it had `dual` in the prefix
but actually meant TP=4 (4-card config). The clean shape: GPU
count is implicit when there's no ambiguity (`single` always 1,
`dual` always 2), and explicit when there is (`multi3` / `multi4`
/ `multi8`).

Renames:
- docker-compose.dual4.yml         → docker-compose.multi4.yml
- docker-compose.dual4-dflash.yml  → docker-compose.multi4-dflash.yml

Registry tags `vllm/dual4` and `vllm/dual4-dflash` in scripts/switch.sh
keep their existing names (backward compat for users running
`bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual4`); only the file paths in the
VARIANTS map are updated.

References updated: BENCHMARKS.md, docs/MULTI_CARD.md, docs/UPSTREAM.md,
models/qwen3.6-27b/CHANGELOG.md, models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/README.md,
sibling-table cross-references in 7 other compose headers.

AGENTS.md "Topology prefix" row tightened: examples now read
`single · dual · multi3 · multi4 · multi8` (dropped `dual-nvlink`
which is actually an interconnect feature suffix; dropped `quad`
which doesn't exist as a name in our convention).

- **composes: complete profile-schema header rollout (8 more composes)** ([fca643d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/fca643d6437bfc79522da57278a7001d1b268887))


Adds the at-a-glance "Profile" block to the remaining composes for
full coverage across all 27 shipped + experimental compose files:

Qwen vLLM (5):
- docker-compose.yml (single-card default)
- docker-compose.long-text-no-mtp.yml
- docker-compose.long-vision.yml
- docker-compose.minimal.yml
- docker-compose.tools-text.yml

Qwen llama.cpp (2):
- docker-compose.yml (262K cliff-immune fallback)
- docker-compose.concurrent.yml (4-slot multi-tenant)

Each schema declares: Model / Topology / Drafter / KV / Vision /
Max ctx / Genesis / Best-for. The qwopus-bf16mtp.yml schema (still
untracked, preview-status) is also updated locally for consistency.

This completes the Option A naming/documentation pass:
  Total composes:        27
  With profile schemas:  27 (100%)

- **compose: extend VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER hook to dual / dual-nvlink / dual4 + HARDWARE.md docs** ([5ec40c6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/5ec40c65ffd47b805026a9e65023a3bfe0a1dbd4))


PR #99 (@easel) added the env-var hook to 8 PN59/GDN-class composes that
already had bash entrypoint wrappers. The 3 missing composes (dual.yml,
dual-nvlink.yml, dual4.yml) used direct command: arrays with no bash
wrapper, so they're brought into parity here by adding a minimal
entrypoint that does only the optional --enforce-eager interpolation.

Also documents the third WSL2 / laptop workaround in HARDWARE.md
alongside the TDR fix and expandable_segments:False pattern, plus a
combined three-variable .env template (GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION,
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF, VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER) that's the typical landing
point for WSL2 / laptop GPU rigs with reduced VRAM headroom.

Validation: docker compose config parses cleanly on all 3 modified
composes; bash interpolation behaves correctly (empty when unset,
--enforce-eager prepended when set).

- **compose: VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER env hook + WSL2 .env docs** ([#99](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/99) by @easel)


Adds env-var hook `${VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER:+--enforce-eager}` to entrypoint of all 8 PN59/GDN-class vLLM composes so WSL2/laptop users can enable Cliff 2 GDN-spike mitigation via gitignored `compose/.env` instead of editing tracked files. Documents the WSL2/laptop override pattern (GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.94, PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False, VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1) in the bounded-thinking compose. PN54 default-on attempt was correctly reverted to opt-in (no isolated A/B signal). Tested on RTX 5090 Laptop + WSL2 driver 596.36 by @easel.

Follow-up commit will extend hook to dual.yml / dual-nvlink.yml / dual4.yml + add VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER documentation to docs/HARDWARE.md WSL2 section.

- **Add dual-nvlink-dflash-noviz compose variant (NVLink + DFlash N=5, 200K ctx, no vision)** ([63ab224](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/63ab224c570516f158eee13cde22afcd9a4ba944))
- **Add docker-compose.dual-nvlink-dflash.yml (#92)** ([#92](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/92) by @danbedford)


Adds NVLink-enabled DFlash compose for 2× 3090 with NVLink bridge.

Mirrors `docker-compose.dual-dflash.yml` but enables NCCL P2P over NVLink
(`NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL`) and re-enables vLLM's custom all-reduce kernel.
Drops `expandable_segments=True` per JusefPol's NVLink startup-crash report (#31).

Validation (rig: 2× 3090 + NVLink, 230W cap, EDT — see PR body):
- verify-full: 8/8 PASS
- verify-stress: 7/7 PASS (incl. 91K Cliff 2 needle)
- soak-continuous: PASS (0 errors, 0 silent-empty, 0 MiB growth, 100% TPS retention)
- Canonical bench: narr 101.55 / code 163.33 wall TPS (CV 1.8% / 1.9%)

NVLink lift vs his own PCIe baseline (`dual-dflash.yml` 86.62 / 141.02):
+17% narr / +16% code — matches the +15-19% NVLink lift the controlled
A/B in BENCHMARKS shows on DFlash paths (K+1 verify is heavily cross-card
matmul).

Port: 8018. Status: community-contributed, experimental.

- **composes: PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF env-override knob + WSL2 boot-crash docs (#84)** ([#84](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/84) by @easel)


A single-card RTX 3090 Ti rig on WSL2 (driver 596.36) hits
RuntimeError: CUDA driver error: device not ready from gptq_marlin_repack
immediately after weight load on the v7.72.2-uplift nightly pin.
Bisect ruled out Genesis, spec-decode, TQ3 KV, async-residual error,
and TDR (registry already extended + Windows rebooted).
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False resolves it. Same
env-var workaround as JusefPol's NVLink boot-crash (PR #31), already
hardcoded in the dual-nvlink*.yml composes.

Replaces the hardcoded PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF line in 14 single-card
and PCIe dual-card composes with a ${PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF:-...}
override (defaults preserved). Pattern matches existing MAX_MODEL_LEN /
GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION overrides from #79. The two dual-nvlink*.yml
composes are unchanged — their existing JusefPol-driven default already
has expandable_segments off.

Documentation:
- docs/HARDWARE.md: new "disable PyTorch expandable_segments" subsection
  alongside the TDR fix, with stack trace, what was ruled out, override
  recipe, and a single uncontrolled observation about weight-load time
  (32 sec → 13 sec).
- docs/FAQ.md: WSL2 question now cross-links both the TDR and
  expandable_segments fix subsections.
- .env.example: documents the override under "vLLM tuning knobs".
- CHANGELOG.md (top-level + per-model): dated 2026-05-06 entries.

The exact failing call hasn't been isolated. The cuMemMap virtual-memory
API used by expandable_segments:True is the suspected culprit since
both known occurrences respond to the same workaround, but no specific
call has been proven to return cudaErrorNotReady.

- **Add Gemma 4 + DFlash compose (vLLM PR #41703 Codex-rebased overlay) (#81)** ([#81](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/81) by @noonghunna)


Cross-rig data on z-lab/gemma-4-31B-it-DFlash block-diffusion drafter — first
Ampere consumer benchmark of DFlash on Gemma 4. PR #41703 was needs-rebase
against pre-SpecDecodeBaseProposer-refactor main; ChatGPT/Codex cherry-picked
the 6 PR commits onto upstream/main 5d0fd87038b cleanly with one manual fix
on top (_warn_if_multimodal → _raise_if_multimodal rename, otherwise
multimodal inputs throw NotImplementedError).

Bench at shipped n=7 (TP=2, 2× 3090 PCIe, 230W cap):
  narrative:  95 wall TPS  (1.56× over no-spec-decode baseline)
  code:      168 wall TPS  (2.74× over baseline)
  Avg accept code: ~60%, AL 5.23

n-sweep summary (n=4..15): code TPS saturates at n=7; n=8 strictly dominated
by n=7 (worse on both narr+code); n=15 past the knee. Narrative monotonically
degrades with bigger n — n=5 is best for prose at 109/141, override hint
documented in compose comment for chat workloads.

Soak PASS: 100 turns, 0 errors, 0 silent-empty, 0 MiB growth, 98.6% TPS
retention, p50 decode 55.78 TPS (vs 52.71 at n=5 — n=7 is strictly better
under soak conditions too, with 2.2 GB lower peak VRAM).

DFlash vs MTP on Gemma 4: DFlash wins code (+18%), MTP wins narrative (+15%).
Different operating regimes — block-diffusion's larger draft horizon helps
deterministic code more than prose.

Adds:
- models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/compose/docker-compose.gemma-dflash.yml
- models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/vllm-gemma4-dflash/ (12 RO-mounted Python
  files + README documenting provenance + drop conditions)
- scripts/switch.sh entry: vllm/gemma-dflash → port 8032
- BENCHMARKS.md row under Gemma 4 31B section

- **composes: env-override knobs MAX_MODEL_LEN + GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION (#79)** ([#79](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/79) by @noonghunna)


* composes: env-override knobs MAX_MODEL_LEN + GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION

Two cross-rig users hit the same friction within hours of each other:
  - @laurimyllari (4090, disc #62 / issue #71): default max_model_len=180000
    on long-text.yml exceeded his rig's KV-cache budget; had to drop to 90K
  - @PiotrZadka (disc #66): wants to run vLLM alongside a desktop session
    on the same GPU; needs to reserve some VRAM for X server / browser etc.

Both root causes are the same: composes were calibrated for headless 3090
with no other VRAM consumers, and there's no clean override path short of
hand-editing the YAML.

Add env-substitution for the two knobs with the highest "shrink to fit"
elasticity:

  --max-model-len            ${MAX_MODEL_LEN:-<existing default>}
  --gpu-memory-utilization   ${GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION:-<existing default>}

Existing defaults preserved verbatim — zero behavior change for users who
don't set the env. Pattern matches existing ${MODEL_DIR:-...},
${PORT:-...}, ${HF_TOKEN:-...} substitutions in our composes.

Usage:

  # Default (unchanged):
  bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/long-text     # max_model_len=180000

  # Override for desktop-coexist or sub-24 GB VRAM:
  MAX_MODEL_LEN=32768 GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.80 \\
    bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/long-text

Validated end-to-end on long-text.yml:

  $ MAX_MODEL_LEN=32768 GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.80 \\
      bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/long-text
  $ docker exec vllm-qwen36-27b-long-text ps aux | grep vllm
  ... --max-model-len 32768 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.80 ...

Default boot also unaffected:

  $ docker compose -f .../docker-compose.long-text.yml config | \\
      grep -A1 "max-model-len\|gpu-memory-utilization"
  - --max-model-len
  - "180000"          # original default preserved
  - --gpu-memory-utilization
  - "0.93"            # original default preserved

18 vLLM composes touched. Mechanical find/replace; one YAML pattern,
no logic changes. Doesn't touch llama-cpp composes (different flag
shape; out of scope for this PR).

Closes the friction reported on disc #62 + disc #66.

* docs: env-override knobs for desktop-coexist + sub-24 GB usable VRAM

Document MAX_MODEL_LEN + GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION env overrides shipped in
the composes. Two surfaces:

  - docs/SINGLE_CARD.md "Running alongside a desktop / sub-24 GB usable
    VRAM" — explains the override pattern, when to drop which knob, safe
    ranges. Calls out empirically that GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.80 is
    too aggressive for TQ3 KV paths (vLLM profiling overhead consumes
    more than the saved 0.05 budget; engine init reports
    'No available memory for the cache blocks').
  - docs/HARDWARE.md "Note for sub-24 GB cards" — adds a 4090-with-display
    paragraph above the existing 20 GB modded-3080 note. Cites
    @laurimyllari's MAX_MODEL_LEN=90000 fit on 4090 long-text.yml.

Validated end-to-end during the env-override implementation:
  - ps aux inside container confirms override values reach vLLM CLI
  - Default boot unchanged (env unset → original values reach CLI)
  - 0.80 mem-util on long-text dies cleanly with the documented error,
    which is what surfaced the "stay 0.85-0.92 for TQ3" guidance

* add Gemma 4 31B + Google MTP drafter — first Ampere consumer cross-rig data

Adds models/gemma-4-31b/ tree with two compose variants (TP=2 + TP=1),
vendored vLLM PR #41745 overlay, switch.sh / launch.sh wiring, plus the
script-level extensions needed to make `bash scripts/{bench,verify-*,

  official `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` image. Single slot,
  262K ctx, Q3_K_XL + q4_0 KV + mmproj vision. ~20 GB / 24 GB VRAM
  budget. The "easy mode" path: one Docker pull, one GGUF, full ctx.

- **Add long-vision + long-text composes (formalize R3' / R3''' bench rows)** ([b641719](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b641719eb815de978f01ddb6c2caed978cb45408))


The v714 formalization round (2026-04-27) measured these as opt-in tiers
edit-able into docker-compose.yml. That made reproducibility fragile:
users who wanted to boot the exact 192K-vision or 205K-text-only configs
had to hand-edit max-model-len, gpu-memory-utilization, and
--language-model-only. Promoting both to dedicated compose files so
each published bench row boots with a single -f flag.

New composes:
  docker-compose.long-vision.yml  192K + 0.98 + vision (R3', 51/68 TPS)
  docker-compose.long-text.yml    205K + 0.98 + no vision (R3''', 50/66 TPS)

Both validate via `docker compose config`. Both carry the same prefill
cliff caveats as the edit-the-default approach did:
  - Cliff 1: ≥25K-token tool-message prefills OOM (ampersandru #1 class)
  - Cliff 2: ≥50-60K single prompts OOM (DeltaNet GDN forward, hardware-bound)
The full 192K/205K is for steady-state context accumulation across many
small turns, NOT for stuffing 192K of fresh tokens in one request.

Header / docs alignment:
  - models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md: variant table now lists long-vision +
    long-text rows; Quick map updated.
  - models/qwen3.6-27b/USE_CASES.md: Frontier 192K-262K section now
    references both composes directly instead of "edit the default".
  - vllm/README.md: "Pick a compose" code block adds two boot lines.
  - default's header variant matrix lists the new files.
  - CHANGELOG.md: dated entry documenting the addition + rationale.

Did NOT add separate composes for 64K / 96K / 128K opt-in tiers. Those
are interpolation points between the safe default (48K) and the
frontier (192K/205K); users can edit if they want a midpoint, but it's
not worth a separate file per benchmarked combination.



### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **fix: verify-full.sh broken pipe + llama-cpp DISABLE_THINKING env hook** ([8f103f3](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/8f103f33ec8ed42c293e12b6bb39e73f736b1946))


Two independent fixes for two recently filed issues:

1. verify-full.sh check_patches "Broken pipe" errors (issue #101 by @a-p-l):
   The three `echo "$docker_logs" | grep -q ...` checks emitted
   "echo: write error: Broken pipe" on stderr after a successful match,
   because grep -q closes stdin early and the upstream echo writes to a
   closed pipe. Spurious noise that didn't affect functionality but
   looked like a real failure. Replaced with bash here-strings
   (`grep -q "..." <<< "$docker_logs"`) which feed grep's stdin
   directly without the pipe race. Patch as proposed in the issue.

2. llama-cpp compose DISABLE_THINKING env hook (issue #97 by @syangsao):
   Refactor llama.cpp compose entrypoint pattern to match PR #99's
   vLLM hook style. Adds a bash entrypoint that conditionally appends
   `--chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking":false}'` when
   DISABLE_THINKING=1 in compose/.env. Forces the model to emit empty
   <think></think> blocks → response goes straight to actual output,
   no thinking-content visible in client UI. Resolves opencode's
   leftover-think-block cosmetic issue when the client doesn't expose
   extra_body for chat_template_kwargs.

   Tradeoff: applies to ALL clients on this server instance — Hermes
   agents that use thinking lose reasoning capability. Users who run
   both opencode and a thinking-using client should run two server
   instances (different ports) with DISABLE_THINKING=1 only on the
   opencode-facing one.

   Also converts `command:` from folded scalar string to YAML list
   (one item per flag/value) to support the bash $@ pattern.

- **fix(preflight): catch missing llama.cpp GGUF before container boot (#63)** ([#63](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/63) by @noonghunna)


* fix(preflight): catch missing llama.cpp GGUF before container boot

preflight_compose_deps was vLLM-only — it always required the AutoRound
INT4 weights and never validated llama.cpp GGUF / mmproj mounts. Result:
fresh users following the README to switch to llamacpp/default would hit
a 600s container timeout buried in docker logs (syangsao on #58).

Make preflight engine-aware: detect llama.cpp composes by image, parse
the `-m /models/<path>` and `--mmproj /models/<path>` args (resolving
${GGUF_FILE:-...} / ${MMPROJ_FILE:-...} defaults, env-var overrides win),
and surface a copy-pasteable `hf download unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF ...`
one-liner when files are missing.

Verified:
- llamacpp/default + missing GGUF → preflight errors with clear fix
- llamacpp/concurrent → same correct behavior
- vllm/dual on /mnt/models/huggingface → no regression

Closes the trip-hazard on #58. setup.sh stays vLLM-default so fresh
clones don't pay 16 GB for a path most users won't take first.

* fix(preflight): correct hf download CLI form (positional, not --include)

syangsao tested PR #63 and the suggested one-liner only fetched
mmproj-F16.gguf (928 MB), not the main 14 GB GGUF. Root cause:

  hf download unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF \
    --include 'Qwen3.6-27B-UD-Q3_K_XL.gguf' 'mmproj-F16.gguf' \
    --local-dir <dir>

`hf download` parses positional [FILENAMES]... args; when both
--include and positional filenames are passed, --include is silently
ignored:

  UserWarning: Ignoring `--include` since filenames have being
  explicitly set.

So the second arg ('mmproj-F16.gguf') becomes the only filename to
fetch, and the main weights are skipped. Fix: drop --include and
list both files as positional args, matching `hf download`'s own
example in --help:

  hf download meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct config.json tokenizer.json

Also clarified the mmproj-move comment: this isn't a "sometimes" —
unsloth ships mmproj-F16.gguf at the top of the GGUF repo, so it
always lands inside the --local-dir we pass. The compose default
points at qwen3.6-27b/mmproj-F16.gguf (one level up from
unsloth-q3kxl/), so the move is mandatory, not conditional.

- **fix(soak): flag silent-empty turns (HTTP 200 + 0 tokens) as warnings** ([f32d8a6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f32d8a69721059537557dcaeaaf522732798339a))


Previously soak-test.sh verdict treated `status != 200 or error` as the
only error class. Turns where the engine returned HTTP 200 OK but emitted
zero completion tokens (commonly: xgrammar mask rejecting all candidates,
client max_tokens exhausted by `<think>` block, or spec-decode returning
an empty draft batch) slipped through and the run reported PASS while
the workload-level failure was firing.

Discovered when @efschu posted a soak-continuous run on `dual-turbo.yml`
+ fp8_e5m2 KV (club-3090#47) where 2 of 25 turns logged decode_tps=0.0
with status=200 — same silent-empty failure mode @stiggy2k16 reported
in #43 — but the verdict was PASS because they weren't HTTP errors.

Changes:
- soak-test.sh: TURN_LOG header now includes `completion_tokens` column.
- soak-helper.py: append-log writes completion_tokens. Summary detects
  silent-empty turns via `status == 200 && !error && decode_tps == 0
  && t_ms >= 1000`. Counts >=50% silent-empty as a verdict failure;
  1-49% as a warning (run can still PASS for Cliff 2b but flags the
  workload-level bug). Back-compat with pre-2026-05-04 CSVs because
  decode_tps was always recorded.
- Console + markdown summary both surface `silent_empty N/M (X.X%)`.

Tested against existing soak-20260503-151203/turn-log.csv (silent_empty
0/25, no false positives despite missing column) and a synthetic
recreation of efschu's run (silent_empty 2/15 as expected, verdict
stays PASS with a warning).

- **fix(soak-test, switch): calibration + boot-progress UX from first cross-rig runs** ([8e9cf70](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/8e9cf70d9997d04336ead0eb7664cac608b64b3c))


Three calibration fixes to soak-test + two boot-progress improvements to
switch.sh, all from the first cross-rig soak runs on this rig today.

soak-test.sh — baseline timing
  Brief said "capture warm baseline after first turn" but turn 3 ships a
  12K-char tool-result paste that fills prefix cache by ~1000 MiB on the
  first hit. With baseline at turn 1, every healthy config false-positives
  with "growth > 200 MiB threshold" on session 1 alone. Fixed: capture
  baseline at end of session 1 (after all 5 turn shapes run once). Sessions
  2-N then measure real accretion from steady state.

soak-helper.py — decode_tps guard
  Thinking-mode requests where vLLM bundles all reasoning into the terminal
  streaming chunk produce wall ≈ ttft (no separate content delta visible).
  Old code computed decode_tps = completion_tokens / (wall - ttft) with
  wall - ttft ≈ 0, yielding ~2 billion TPS. Fixed: when ttft is None OR
  wall - ttft < 100ms, report decode_tps = 0 (caller filterable).

soak-helper.py — TPS outlier filter in cmd_summary
  Defensive — even if a future helper bug regresses, we filter unrealistic
  decode_tps values (>500 t/s) from all summary computations. tps_retention
  metric was previously being inflated by 2e9 outliers in early sessions
  before the helper-bug landed mid-run.

Cross-rig validation results:

  Config                          Baseline   Max VRAM   Growth   Verdict
  vllm/long-text 180K + 0.93      23316      23316      0 MiB    PASS
  vllm/long-vision 145K + 0.95    22778      22778      0 MiB    PASS

Both configs are soak-clean under v1 synthetic shapes. Long-vision was
expected to FAIL based on issue #41 — but our 5-turn fixtures reset the
conversation each turn while hermes accumulates context across turns.
v1 catches a class of issue (raw VRAM accretion across requests); v2
fixtures will need session = continuous conversation to catch the
hermes-shaped class. Methodology limitation documented in CHANGELOG.

switch.sh — wait_ready crash detection + boot-stage progress
  Closes the "container crashed silently in 2s, you wait 600s for nothing"
  UX gap that surfaced today when long-text's MODEL_DIR was misconfigured.
  - Crash detection: docker inspect -f '{{.State.Running}}' between polls;
    if false, dump last 30 log lines + exit 1 immediately (5s vs 600s)
  - Boot-stage markers: grep docker logs for "Resolved architecture",
    "Loading weights", "Compilation finished", "Capturing CUDA graphs",
    "Application startup complete" — surface one line per phase transition
    so the wait isn't silent.
  Validated end-to-end on long-vision boot today: visible progress at
  60s / 68s / 80s / 120s / 176s / 196s = ready.

- **fix(dual-nvlink): rename to avoid collision + vendored Marlin path** ([147f2e3](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/147f2e33ee8e8c021ab70f000928927326e9b4e8))


Continuing JusefPol's PR #31 — applies the must-fix items so it can ship
without asking JusefPol to push more changes. Original community contribution
intact (NVLink env vars + custom-all-reduce flag flips + alloc-conf change);
this commit adjusts only what blocks landing.

Changes:
  - container_name: vllm-qwen36-27b-dual → vllm-qwen36-27b-dual-nvlink
    (the compose was a sibling, not a replacement — dual.yml stays the PCIe
    default and the two must coexist on a rig that wants to A/B them)
  - PORT default: 8010 → 8014 (8010 belongs to dual.yml; the next free slot
    after dual-dflash-noviz=8013 is 8014)
  - Header rewritten — flagged as community/experimental opt-in, not "DEFAULT
    for 2× cards". Notes the maintainer doesn't have NVLink hardware to
    canonical-bench, points NVLink users to discussion #19 for numbers.
  - Stale "PCIe-only (no NVLink — works fine)" dependency note replaced with
    NVLink-bridge prerequisite + 'nvidia-smi topo -m' check hint.
  - Stale variant table (still listed dual.yml as "(this)") refreshed with a
    new "NVLink" column; dual-nvlink shows up under its own row.
  - Marlin patch mounts moved from /opt/ai/vllm-src/ host paths to the
    in-repo vendored copy at ../patches/vllm-marlin-pad/, matching the
    refactor in d8b341f.

Comments preserved verbatim where JusefPol's original wording explains why
he diverged from dual.yml (P2P enabled, P2P_LEVEL=NVL, expandable_segments
removed) — those are his findings, not ours, so they get attribution context
in the new header.

- **fix(default compose): swap P65 (cudagraph workaround) → P67 (proper Triton kernel fix)** ([620d918](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/620d918db3c0a346ae245ffaf78b7ecf0d789f70))


The default docker-compose.yml was the only Genesis-using compose
still on the older P65 cudagraph-downgrade workaround for vllm#40880
(silent tool-call cascade under MTP × TurboQuant × cudagraph). Every
other Genesis-loading variant moved to P67 (proper multi-query Triton
kernel) in commits a26e30b + 22e6549.

A/B benched on local rig before flipping (n=5 measured, 3 warmups,
canonical narr + code prompts):

  Arm A (P65 shipped):  49.61 narr / 64.93 code TPS  (CV 1.9% / 2.2%)
  Arm B (P67 flipped):  49.60 narr / 64.28 code TPS  (CV 3.4% / 1.0%)

Result: dead even at concurrency=1, both within run-to-run variance.
Sandermage's claimed +25-35% on P67 is on multi-query continuation
prefill (spec-verify K+1 batches with prior cached KV); the default
48K config + max_num_batched_tokens=4128 rarely exercises that
surface, so the gain doesn't materialize at our measurement posture.
P67's win likely shows up at concurrency >1 or longer context.

Shipping the flip anyway:

- Consistency: all 5 Genesis-using composes now use P67. Default
  standing alone on P65 makes future dispatcher-v2 audits harder.
- Architectural correctness: P67 is the proper Triton kernel fix.
  P65 forces PIECEWISE cudagraph mode (a workaround for the captured-
  graph corruption bug). When the proper fix exists, ship the proper
  fix.
- Future-proofing: Genesis v7.70+ may escalate dispatcher rules
  further. Better to land on the architecturally-correct mechanism
  while we have time to test.
- Possible upside at concurrency >1 (not measured here).

Risk is purely "behavioral change to user-facing default compose."
The bench shows no regression; spec-decode AL + per-position accept
rates are identical between arms. Closes the audit gap left by the
GENESIS_ENABLE_P85 / P65 cleanup work.

After this commit:
  docker-compose.yml                  P65=0 P67=1 P85=0  ✓ (this fix)
  All other Genesis-using composes already at P67=1.

Default compose now consistent with the rest of the stack.

- **fix(long-text-no-mtp): drop P65 + P85 — missed in a26e30b** ([22e6549](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/22e654989b5658b09af989508584ce635826398e))


Auditing all 11 composes after a26e30b shipped revealed
docker-compose.long-text-no-mtp.yml still had GENESIS_ENABLE_P65 +
P85 + P67 simultaneously — same dispatcher v2 conflict that we
just fixed in long-text/long-vision/bounded-thinking/dual-turbo.

This compose was added in the v7.69 cutover (commit 15b84df)
copying long-text.yml's env-var bundle but with MTP disabled. The
P65/P85 entries inherited from long-text.yml at that time, when the
old bundle was still committed. The previous fix (a26e30b) caught
all four composes that pre-existed but missed this one.

Same fix applied: drop P65 (mutually exclusive with P67), drop P85
(requires P84). Keeps P67 (the proper Triton kernel fix that
supersedes P65).

Default docker-compose.yml status: still uses P65 (workaround) without
P67 (proper fix). No dispatcher v2 conflict because P67 isn't on. But
it's the only compose still on the older mechanism. Decision deferred
to a future commit that includes bench validation of the P65 → P67
flip on the default 48K config.

- **fix(composes): drop GENESIS_ENABLE_P65 + P85 — out of sync with v7.69 dispatcher v2** ([a26e30b](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a26e30b279d5dacbdaf7489c5dfb8d1203219166))


Reported by @efschu in discussion #25 — Genesis v7.69 dispatcher v2
fires validator errors on our shipped env-var bundles:

  validator ERROR: P85 — missing required dependency: P85 requires 'P84'
                   to also be APPLY (currently SKIP)
  validator ERROR: P67 — conflict: P65 and P67 are both APPLY but
                   declared mutually exclusive — pick one
  validator ERROR: P67b — conflict: P65 and P67b are both APPLY but
                   declared mutually exclusive — pick one

The conflicts are real. Our shipped env vars in long-text.yml,
long-vision.yml, bounded-thinking.yml, and dual-turbo.yml all enabled
GENESIS_ENABLE_P65 + P67 + P85 simultaneously. v7.69 dispatcher v2
declares:

- **P65 vs P67/P67b**: P65 was the cudagraph-downgrade *workaround* for
  the spec-decode cascade bug (#40880). P67/P67b is the *proper Triton
  kernel fix* designed to replace it. Now that P67 is mature in v7.69,
  the dispatcher won't allow the workaround AND the fix simultaneously.
  Resolution: drop P65, keep P67. P67 supersedes P65 functionally.

- **P85 → P84**: P85 (hybrid fine-shadow prefix cache) requires P84
  (hash_block_size override, the actual root-cause fix for vllm#38182).
  We had P85 on but P84 unconfigured. Resolution: drop P85. P85 is
  opt-in optimization not load-bearing for correctness; enabling P84
  separately would need bench validation and is a future decision.

Verified on local test rig:
  Before: Genesis Results: 63 applied, 36 skipped, 0 failed
          (with 3 validator ERROR messages mid-log, non-blocking on
          our rig but confirmed blocking on @efschu's 2× 3080)
  After:  Genesis Results: 61 applied, 38 skipped, 0 failed
          0 validator errors, P67 active, P65 properly skipped,
          Application startup complete clean

Note: validator errors were non-blocking on our 3090 rig but @efschu
reports they break boot on 2× 3080 (different regime detection in
Genesis dispatcher → different error handling). Either way, they
indicate a config bug on our side and the fix is the same.

Comments added inline at each removal site so future maintainers
understand why the env vars were dropped (and that re-adding requires
checking dispatcher v2 conflict matrix).

Awaiting @efschu's confirmation log to see if this also unblocks his
2× 3080 boot, but the env-var conflict fix should land regardless.

- **fix(setup.sh): auto-clone vllm-src Marlin patched fork (was manual step)** ([2e934ad](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2e934ad18ad70d98e2e314ca3a96759935393949))


Reported in #37 by @snoby — the dual-card vLLM composes mount two
patched files from /opt/ai/vllm-src/ (our vllm#40361 PR — Marlin pad-
sub-tile-n) which the user has to clone manually. The setup.sh script
PRINTED the instruction but didn't run it. Quick-start advertised
"clone + setup + compose up" but for dual-card paths, an additional
manual `git clone` was required. Not turnkey.

Adds a WITH_MARLIN_PATCH=1 (default-on) env-var following the existing
WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1 pattern. Clones the patched fork to /opt/ai/vllm-src/
automatically during setup.sh, with sudo fallback for /opt/ai dir
creation. ~30 MB shallow clone — harmless overhead for single-card
users who'll never mount it.

Set WITH_MARLIN_PATCH=0 to skip explicitly (e.g., users without sudo
access to /opt/ai). Setup will print a warning that dual-card composes
will fail to boot without the patch.

Idempotent: if /opt/ai/vllm-src/.git already exists, fetches + checks
out the marlin-pad-sub-tile-n branch instead of re-cloning.

Drops out as a dependency when vllm#40361 lands upstream — at which
point we'd remove the env-var, the host mounts in dual composes, and
the /opt/ai/vllm-src/ directory.

The bigger architectural fix snoby's report points at — converting the
host-mount to a runtime patch sidecar (like patch_tolist_cudagraph.py)
to fully eliminate the host filesystem dependency — is a separate
refactor. This commit just closes the most painful UX gap (manual step
hidden in setup output) without that bigger surgery.

- **fix(docs): replace dead luce-spec/llama-cpp-dflash links with Luce-Org/lucebox-hub** ([e9c658c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e9c658cbc6ca453e9502b20a6fa6e682b2e5f752))


Reported in #39 by @clort81 — the `luce-spec/llama-cpp-dflash` repo
returns 404. The DFlash work consolidated into Luce-Org/lucebox-hub
(verified: github.com/Luce-Org/lucebox-hub returns 200, contains
dflash/ + pflash/ subdirs and dflash/deps/llama.cpp submodule).

Affected files:
- docs/engines/README.md (2 link sites in comparison table)
- docs/engines/LLAMA_CPP.md (4 sites: intro, "Pros" table, build clone
  command, "See also" links)
- models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/README.md (2 link sites)

Plus collateral updates:
- Build clone path /opt/llama-cpp-dflash → /opt/lucebox-hub (matches
  the new repo name; was a 3-replace via path globbing)
- HF model path luce-spec/dflash-qwen3.6-27b-N5 (401 gated) →
  z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash (200 public, the actually-shipping draft)
  + local-dir adjusted to /mnt/models/huggingface/z-lab/... matching
  the canonical HF model path convention
- `git clone --recurse-submodules` flag added since lucebox-hub uses
  submodules for its bundled llama.cpp fork (in dflash/deps/llama.cpp)

Updates URL framing in user-facing prose to acknowledge that
lucebox-hub is a separate harness containing a llama.cpp fork rather
than just being a llama.cpp fork. The recipe section build commands
should be re-verified against the lucebox-hub README before treating
them as canonical — this commit only updates the URL/path; the multi-
step build instructions in docs/engines/LLAMA_CPP.md may need a
follow-up walkthrough.

CHANGELOG references to luce-spec preserved as historical context (the
links were valid at the time the CHANGELOG entries were written).

- **fix(scripts): register vllm/long-text-no-mtp in switch.sh + launch.sh** ([1f09a05](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1f09a059d59138288bf630881c6870dacc91d9ed))


[@wispborne](https://github.com/wispborne) caught: docker-compose.long-text-no-mtp.yml
ships in the v7.69 cutover but its corresponding variant key wasn't added
to scripts/switch.sh's VARIANTS map or scripts/launch.sh's wizard list.
Result: \`bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/long-text-no-mtp\` failed and the
wizard never offered it.

Adds:
- scripts/switch.sh:
  * VARIANT_DEFAULT_PORT[vllm/long-text-no-mtp]=8021 (matches compose)
  * VARIANTS[vllm/long-text-no-mtp]= compose path
  * RUNNING_PATTERN extended to match its container name
  * Header docs updated: long-text 218K → 180K (Balanced MTP), new
    long-text-no-mtp 200K (Max-context) line
- scripts/launch.sh:
  * VLLM_OPTS wizard list — both Balanced MTP + Max-context surfaced
    explicitly, with correct ctx ceilings (180K + 200K, not stale 218K)
  * LAUNCH_DEFAULT_PORT + LAUNCH_DEFAULT_CONTAINER updated to match

Stale 218K references in the wizard description corrected to current
shipped values: long-text is 180K (after the 0.93 mem-util backoff +
v7.69 cutover), long-text-no-mtp is 200K + 0.95.

- **fix(dflash): close the docs+setup gap that hit @lolren on club-3090#18** ([eb54cf4](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/eb54cf4e68da057a884b8d5fa8d26c8fd04969a0))


@lolren reported 25 TPS on dual-dflash.yml vs 80+ on dual.yml — root
cause was that scripts/setup.sh doesn't download the DFlash draft model
(z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash), and the compose path
/root/.cache/huggingface/qwen3.6-27b-dflash silently fell back to
baseline bf16 decode when missing. There was no docs page that told
users they needed to grab it separately, and UPSTREAM.md's "watch list"
framing for the z-lab draft was muddled with the shipping vLLM compose.

Three closes:

1. scripts/setup.sh — new WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1 env var. When set, fetches
   z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash to <MODEL_DIR>/qwen3.6-27b-dflash/ after the
   main model. Bumps disk preflight from 25 to 28 GB. Documents that the
   draft is still under training (per UPSTREAM.md re-test trigger).

2. docker-compose.dual-dflash.yml + dual-dflash-noviz.yml headers — added
   explicit "Prerequisite" block with both `WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1` and
   manual `hf download` instructions, plus the under-training caveat.

3. docs/UPSTREAM.md + docs/DUAL_CARD.md — reconciled the inconsistency.
   UPSTREAM.md now explicitly distinguishes "Luce-Org/lucebox-hub
   (single-card llama.cpp fork — not shipping)" from "vLLM dual-dflash
   compose (shipping with same draft, different engine)". DUAL_CARD.md's
   peak code TPS section now flags the prereq + recommends dual.yml
   (FP8 + MTP) for autonomous coding agents until z-lab tags
   training-complete.

- **fix(verify): drop tail buffer on Genesis check 2 anchor (refines 95b0905)** ([f2c1433](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f2c143326ea710cd1b724407dff5367930f14534))


@JusefPol's NVLink dual-turbo run (club-3090#29) hit the same "skip"
result even after 95b0905, because Genesis v7.14+ emits ~50 "[Genesis]
applied:" lines + a dispatcher matrix dump before the canonical
"apply_all elapsed:" anchor fires. Tail -10 was cutting off the anchor.

Fix: remove the tail entirely. Run grep -q against the full log in
priority order (FAILED first, then apply_all elapsed, then any applied
line as partial-log fallback). One extra docker logs read per check
in exchange for correctness across rigs that boot fast or generate
verbose Genesis output.

- **fix(verify+docs): close two items from troymroberts cross-rig validation (#25)** ([95b0905](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/95b090567c646e7bbfcada5a05ec622dc9936ca2))


Both reported by @troymroberts during 2× modded 3080 20GB validation
(club-3090#25, comment 16787782).

scripts/verify.sh + scripts/verify-full.sh — check 2 anchor + pipefail bug

  - The "[OK] Qwen3 tool_call fix" marker is no longer emitted by Genesis
    v7.14+. Updated anchor to look for the new canonical markers:
      - "apply_all elapsed:" (fires once when apply_all completes clean)
      - "[Genesis] applied:" (per-patch apply line, partial-log signal)
      - "[Genesis] FAILED" (any patch errored)
  - Wrapped the grep in `{ ... || true; }` so set -euo pipefail doesn't
    abort the whole script when grep returns 1 on no-match (early boot).

docs/HARDWARE.md — added 2× modded 3080 20 GB row + sub-24GB note

  - First validated SM86 / 40 GB combined config outside the 3090 family.
  - Documented the 0.82 mem-util target for 20 GB cards (cudagraph
    profiling overhead is a meaningful slice on smaller VRAM).
  - Also added an A5000 row noting it's Sander's PROD class.

- **fix(launch): pass per-variant URL + CONTAINER to verify-full.sh (#20)** ([77ca576](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/77ca5767f5bf27ba0774edf1ded301c826d66277))


AlexCPU's report: launch.sh selected the dual variant correctly,
switch.sh booted the stack on port 8010 with container
'vllm-qwen36-27b-dual', then ran verify-full.sh without passing URL
or CONTAINER. verify-full fell back to defaults (URL=
http://localhost:8020, CONTAINER=vllm-qwen36-27b) and reported 6/8
checks failed because it was hitting the wrong endpoint.

Fix: move the port-resolution block above the verify call, add a
per-variant container-name mapping mirroring the port mapping, and
pass URL + CONTAINER through to bash $VERIFY. Also surfaces the
resolved values in the launcher output so users can see what the
verify run is actually targeting.

- **fix(docs): bump curl smoke-test max_tokens 30 → 200 (#14)** ([2f8bade](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2f8bade82c53886f2525e0a5cb0efe748b1135e9))


Qwen3.6 thinks before answering by default, so a "Capital of France?"
smoke with max_tokens=30 returns truncated mid-`<think>` content. apnar
hit this on a working stack (verify-full.sh all green) and wasted time
debugging a non-bug.

Bump all 7 user-facing curl examples to max_tokens=200 (covers a typical
think block + the one-sentence answer with headroom).

verify-full.sh / verify.sh / verify-stress.sh stay at max_tokens=30
because they already pass chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false,
which skips the think block entirely.

EXAMPLES.md gets an inline note explaining the headroom + the alternative
(disable thinking via chat_template_kwargs) for users who want a tighter
smoke.

- **fix(vllm): fail fast when Genesis patches volume is empty (#13)** ([0df8f74](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/0df8f743192809dbdcda942887b625b0f48699f2))


GarrickLin reported `NotImplementedError: TurboQuant KV cache is not
supported for hybrid (attention + Mamba) models` from the upstream
vLLM guard at arg_utils.py:1677. Root cause: the user ran
`docker compose up` before `bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b`, so the
host directory backing the `../patches/genesis/vllm/_genesis` volume
mount was empty. Docker silently created an empty dir at the mount
target, `python3 -m vllm._genesis.patches.apply_all` ran but applied
zero patches, and the upstream guard tripped on TQ3 KV + hybrid model.

Add an entrypoint pre-flight that checks for the apply_all module and
fails fast with an actionable error pointing at scripts/setup.sh.
Applied to default / long-vision / tools-text / dual-turbo. (long-text
intentionally skipped — it has an in-flight experimental change being
evaluated; will be brought into parity once that lands or reverts.)

Why: silent application of zero patches is the worst kind of failure
mode — the eventual cryptic error is two layers removed from the
actual cause and burns hours of debugging time.

- **fix: address open issues #1, #4, #7** ([ebacba1](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ebacba1efd052fa3eda7ee3b05f2f8479a2fb2ff))


Closes / addresses 3 reported issues + adds requested feature:

#7 vid (PORT not honored, MODEL_DIR vs MODELS_DIR confusion):
  - All 8 vLLM compose files now use "${PORT:-XXXX}:8000" so .env PORT
    flows through. Defaults preserved per-variant (8020 single, 8010-8013
    dual). llama.cpp composes already had this pattern.
  - scripts/switch.sh: load .env early; per-variant default-port table;
    new resolve_ready_url() picks PORT > variant default for the readiness
    probe.
  - scripts/launch.sh: same default-port table; final endpoint URL printed
    to user reflects actual mapped port.
  - .env.example: ⚠ box callout that variable names are CASE-SENSITIVE
    (MODEL_DIR singular, NOT MODELS_DIR plural — silently ignored).
    New PORT section documenting per-variant defaults.

#4 timxx (tools-text.yml fails "Free memory ... less than desired"):
  - docs/FAQ.md: new entry "Container fails to start: Free memory..."
    explaining the vLLM startup check, the two workarounds (free VRAM /
    lower mem-util), and which configs hit it most often (0.97+ mem-util).
  - Compose defaults unchanged (0.97 stays the right design target on
    headless rigs); the FAQ documents the workaround for users with X11.

#1 fabriciomalta (per-config VRAM column):
  - docs/SINGLE_CARD.md: TL;DR table now has VRAM column with mem-util.
  - docs/DUAL_CARD.md: TL;DR table same + footnote explaining per-card
    semantics and which dual configs would/wouldn't fit on 2× 20 GB cards
    (relevant to fabriciomalta's 2× 3080-20GB use case).

#2 tenitram (empty responses) — fixed in master via aab8ff4
(P68/P69 disabled). Closed with reply pointing at the fix.

### 📊 Benchmarks + cross-rig data

- **results: re-bench dual.yml + dual-dflash + dual-dflash-noviz on v0.20** ([0bdcb69](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/0bdcb69fa3e446442c8bc744dcb588e1697cba55))


Closes the "dual variants not yet re-benched on v0.20" caveat from PR #23.
Confirms no v0.20 regression on fp8 / FP16 paths — code TPS within bench
variance of chart values across all 3.

n=5 measured + 3 warmup per prompt:

| Variant            | Chart (prior) narr / code | v0.20 measured narr / code | Δ                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| dual.yml           | 69.05 / 88.58              | 68.61 / 90.71  (CV 1.8% both) | narr -0.6% / code +2.4% |
| dual-dflash.yml    | 81.94 / 124.93             | 77.12 / 125.97 (CV 2-4%)      | narr -5.9% / code +0.8% |
| dual-dflash-noviz  | 78.19 / 126.99             | 78.94 / 123.18 (CV 2-3%)      | narr +1.0% / code -3.0% |

dual-dflash narrative is the only delta outside CV (-5.9%); could be
substrate (different driver / power state at chart capture) or a minor
DFlash N=5 spec-decode regression on v0.20. Chart value stays — within
±5pp of measured, within bench noise band.

Both dual.yml and dual-dflash* are "Genesis-less by design" (zero Genesis
env vars). The migration only bumped the image SHA on these — no env-var
changes — which is consistent with the flat result. The +50% TPS jump
on TQ k8v4 we reported to Sander in discussion #19 came from enabling
his full PROD env-var stack on the TQ KV path; fp8 / FP16 dual paths
don't share the same patches and don't exhibit a similar bump.

Updated `docs/DUAL_CARD.md` performance summary table with the new
measured numbers + a per-variant Δ column. Per-config summaries written
to `results/v0.20-migration/dual-{yml,dflash,dflash-noviz}.summary`.

- **results: dual-turbo re-bench with corrected env vars (PN22 / PN26 naming fix)** ([077228e](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/077228e81b06aebca3401fc03456f4a3eb55e227))


Post-merge follow-up to PR #23. Captures the dual-turbo TP=2 bench after the
env-var naming fixes (PN22 / PN26 sub-config) actually fire, vs the prior
bench where they were silently no-op.

Honest finding: PN22's advertised "+9-30% TPS on TP>=2" (per PR author of
vllm#39419) doesn't materialize at our small bench sample sizes (n=2 runs/
stream, n=4 streams = 8 total runs at high CV).

| Metric | Prior (PN22 silently OFF) | Fixed (PN22 firing) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| n=1 code wall_TPS    | 76.01 | 76.71 | +0.9% (within CV 4-5%) |
| n=4 aggregate        | 269.03 | 242.94 | -9.7% (within bench-size variance) |
| PN22 boot status     | "PN22=1" matches no env_flag — silent OFF | APPLY (vllm#39419 backport) |
| PN26 sparse-V status | BLOCK_KV / NUM_WARPS / THRESHOLD silently using defaults | 27B-tuned values applied |

The naming corrections are real bugs regardless of TPS impact — PN22 / PN26
sub-config are now actually firing on master. Effect may be more visible at
sustained high batch sizes (Sandermage's PROD bench at 100t × 50-req sustained)
where local-argmax dominates the draft-path latency budget more than at our
single-shot 800-token bench.

Headline numbers from PR #23 (76.01 code / 269 aggregate at n=4) remain the
right reference for docs and charts — re-bench is within noise.

- **docs: refresh 4090 cross-rig knee with @laurimyllari's richer 38-cap sweep** ([20ca297](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/20ca29737897df1d52c7c31ad6674a9d08aca54e))


His earlier 15-cap sweep (260-400W, 16832066) is superseded by a
38-cap sweep at 10W resolution from 230-600W (16854218) — strictly
richer envelope. Two findings worth surfacing:

- Firmware boost-clock plateau at SM 2610 MHz: caps 400-600W produce
  identical 51.96 TPS at 393W actual draw. Auto-plateau detector in
  power-cap-sweep.sh caught both sub-plateaus cleanly (400-470W and
  480-600W).
- decode-concurrent N=4 plateau lower than decode-single (46 vs 52
  TPS) — on a 4090 + 27B Q3_K_XL the GPU is under-load at c=4 even
  at full TDP, so single-stream wins. Useful cross-rig signal.

HARDWARE.md table + chart caption updated; chart regenerated with
both load-mode curves overlaid + plateau zone shaded.

- **AGENTS.md: codify why patches/cache stay engine-level (not under a topology)** ([9fbce96](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9fbce961202965aeccd6851799b7abbdc806d355))


Three rationale points for why models/<m>/<engine>/patches/ and cache/
sit parallel to compose/ rather than nested under each topology:

1. Patches are reused across topologies (e.g. vllm-marlin-pad/ is
   mounted by dual/, multi4/, and every dual/nvlink-*.yml). Topology
   subdir would force symlinks or duplication.
2. Patches are scoped by (model, engine), not topology — a vLLM source
   override doesn't change based on TP value; it's engine-internal.
3. Caches (torch_compile/, triton/) warm-start across composes — sharing
   at engine level means switching from single/default to single/long-text
   reuses JIT'd kernels.

Documents the relative-path convention (../../patches/, ../../cache/
from compose/<topology>/<file>.yml) and the rule for genuinely
topology-specific patches if any ever land: keep at engine level,
document the constraint in the patch's README.

- **AGENTS.md: capture compose naming + profile schema + experimental-compose conventions** ([62e636c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/62e636c0525156e6a98faaf318ce50c85a44de6b))


Three subsections under "Compose variants" documenting the convention
established by the 2026-05-09 Gemma 4 alignment pass:

1. Compose filename convention — <topology>-<feature>.yml, model
   implied by parent directory. Examples: dual.yml, dual-turbo.yml,
   dual-int8.yml, single.yml. Filename collisions across model
   directories are fine (path disambiguates). Registry tags in
   scripts/switch.sh decouple from filenames; rename file paths
   while keeping tags backward-compatible.

2. Profile schema header — every compose declares (Model, Topology,
   Drafter, KV, Vision, Max-ctx, Genesis, Best-for) in a structured
   block at the top, before any free-form description. Schema
   forces explicit declaration; catches drift between header
   description and actual config.

3. Where experimental / unvalidated composes live — same directory
   as shipped composes, untracked until verify-full + verify-stress
   + bench + soak validation passes. Mark with `Status: ⚠️
   EXPERIMENTAL` or `⚠️ PREVIEW` so readers know. Don't create a
   separate experimental/ subdirectory — relative paths to
   ../patches and ../cache would need re-pathing on promotion.

Future Claude sessions and any human contributor cloning this repo
now get this convention loaded by default via AGENTS.md.

- **docs+composes: align Gemma 4 compose names to Qwen's <topology>-<feature>.yml convention** ([fe86b48](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/fe86b48c2134df8b333ff8445f40a7c6205aad0b))


Rename the 4 shipped Gemma composes to drop the redundant `gemma-` prefix
(model is already named by the parent directory `models/gemma-4-31b/`):

- gemma-mtp.yml       → dual.yml          (recommended default, MTP implicit
                                          — matches Qwen's `dual.yml` shape)
- gemma-mtp-int8.yml  → dual-int8.yml     (MTP + INT8 PTH KV variant)
- gemma-mtp-tp1.yml   → single.yml        (TP=1 single-card variant — boot
                                          OOMs on Ampere 24 GB; for 32 GB+ only)
- gemma-dflash.yml    → dual-dflash.yml   (DFlash drafter variant — same shape
                                          as Qwen's `dual-dflash.yml`)

Convention going forward (matches what Qwen has done since launch):
- File name: `<topology>-<feature>.yml`, model implied by parent directory
- Topology: `single` | `dual` | `dual-nvlink` | `dual4` | etc.
- Feature suffix: `-turbo` | `-dflash` | `-int8` | `-awq` | etc.

Registry tags in `scripts/switch.sh` keep their existing names
(`vllm/gemma-mtp`, `vllm/gemma-mtp-tp1`, `vllm/gemma-dflash`) — only the
file paths in the VARIANTS map are updated. This preserves backward
compat for users running `bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/gemma-mtp` etc.

Container names (`vllm-gemma-4-31b-mtp` etc.) are unchanged — they already
include the model name in the `vllm-<model>-<feature>` form, so no rename
needed there.

Plus continuing the at-a-glance profile schema rollout from 4d7356a:
profile blocks added to 9 more Qwen composes (bounded-thinking,
carnice-bf16mtp, dual4, dual4-dflash, dual-nvlink, dual-nvlink-turbo,
dual-nvlink-dflash, dual-nvlink-dflash-noviz, long-text). Each declares
Model / Topology / Drafter / KV / Vision / Max ctx / Genesis / Best-for.

References updated across BENCHMARKS.md, README.md, DUAL_CARD.md,
UPSTREAM.md, scripts/setup.sh, scripts/switch.sh, all 6 Gemma compose
cross-references, model patch READMEs, and codex-brief-dflash-int8.md.

- **docs: surface Gemma 4 31B + add at-a-glance profile schemas to canonical composes** ([4d7356a](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/4d7356aac69fbe46e87cf44083ee84965287ca19))


Gemma 4 31B has been production-ready on dual 3090 since 2026-05-08 (5
shipped composes, full benched data in BENCHMARKS.md, disc #67 thread
posted) but the user-facing surfaces still framed the stack as
Qwen3.6-only. This commit fixes that without renaming any compose files
(Option A: document, don't rename — keeps backward compat with external
GitHub issue/disc references to specific filenames).

Changes:

1. README.md "Supported models" — add Gemma 4 31B row alongside Qwen3.6
   with dual-card-only caveat (single-card boots OOM on Ampere 24 GB
   even at 8K ctx; needs 32 GB+ — validated on RTX 5090 by @apnar).

2. docs/DUAL_CARD.md
   - Split TL;DR into two model sections (Qwen3.6-27B + Gemma 4 31B)
   - Added 6 Gemma config rows: gemma-mtp.yml (32K balanced),
     gemma-mtp-int8.yml (262K + multi-stream variant), gemma-dflash.yml
     (peak code TPS 105/177), gemma-dflash-int8.yml (262K code-optimal,
     gated on PR #42102), gemma-awq.yml (118K AWQ-4bit weights)
   - "Models supported on dual 3090" expanded with substantive Gemma entry
   - "Deep dives" split into per-model + cross-cutting sections,
     adds Gemma model README + disc #67 link

3. Profile schema header added to 8 canonical composes for at-a-glance
   scanning — every compose now declares Model / Topology / Drafter /
   KV / Vision / Max ctx / Genesis / Best-for in a structured comment
   block before the existing free-form description:
   - Qwen: dual.yml, dual-turbo.yml, dual-dflash.yml, dual-dflash-noviz.yml
   - Gemma: gemma-mtp.yml, gemma-mtp-int8.yml, gemma-mtp-tp1.yml,
     gemma-dflash.yml

Schema added to remaining composes (gemma-awq, gemma-dflash-int8, plus
15 Qwen variants) in follow-up commits.

Three documentation/script follow-ups from @easel's #102 re-bench
on RTX 5090 Laptop:

- HARDWARE.md: new "Laptop GPUs — EC-managed power" subsection.
  nvidia-smi -pl returns N/A on laptop-class GPUs (EC owns the
  envelope, not the OS). Documents clock-lock as the only
  software characterization path on laptops.

- CLIFFS.md: new "naming trap" callout in the KV-format section.
  fp8_e5m2 is 8 bits/token; turboquant_3bit_nc packs 3 bits.
  At 180K on 24GB, TQ3 fits where fp8 OOMs (4.36 GiB available
  vs 6.64 GiB needed for fp8). Pin: TQ3 = long-context KV;
  fp8 = short-context throughput.

- verify-stress.sh: auto-detect VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1 in the
  running container's env via docker inspect; when set, bump
  STRESS_LONGCTX_TIMEOUT_S 300→600s and STRESS_TOOL_PREFILL_-
  TIMEOUT_S 240→480s. Eager-mode prefill at 60K-140K runs
  200-290s and was false-positiving as HTTP 000 (curl timeout)
  in @easel's run. Both env vars also exposed for manual override.

- **docs + compose: ship Phase 2 INT8 PTH validation results — 262K Gemma 4 unblocked** ([1e1886a](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1e1886a3a95825f387bcc33badba3a52409e7778))


Phase 2 of the Gemma 4 unblock is FULLY VALIDATED on dual 3090 Ampere.
The headline: 8.2× context lift (32K bf16 ceiling → 262K full native max)
via PR #40391 (rebased) + INT8 per-token-head KV.

Validation chain:

  Phase 1 parity:        gemma-mtp.yml (bf16, 32K)             → 105.91 / 141.11 TPS ✅
  Phase 2 boot:          gemma-mtp-int8.yml (INT8 PTH, 98K)    → 96.16 / 127.11 TPS  ✅
  Phase 2 verify-stress: 7/7 incl. 91K Cliff-2 needle           ✅
  Phase 2 262K boot:     INT8 PTH @ 262K, max-num-seqs=1        ✅
  Phase 2 262K bench:    95.27 / 125.93 TPS (TPS preserved)     ✅
  Phase 2 262K stress:   7/7 PASS                               ✅
  Phase 2 137K NIAH:     "bronze octopus 17" recalled cleanly   ✅

Trade vs Phase 1 baseline (bf16 / 32K):
  Per-stream TPS:    -10% (96/127 vs 106/141)
  Max ctx per req:   +8.2× (262K vs 32K, model native max unlocked)
  KV pool tokens:    +4.6× (455K vs 99K)

Key technical insight (added to UPSTREAM.md):
  INT8 PTH is the Ampere-target dtype, NOT fp8 PTH. Triton fp8e4nv
  kernel is not supported on sm_86 (only fp8e4b15/fp8e5 — Ada/Blackwell
  required for fp8 PTH). PR #40391 fixes the page-size mismatch which
  applies to ANY per-token-head KV format; INT8 dispatches to standard
  torch.int8 ops on Ampere, FP8 dispatches to Triton fp8e4nv (Ada+ only).

Earlier Codex investigation conclusion ("NOT split-able as an overlay")
was based on PARTIAL overlays — full PR #40391 overlay rebased onto
post-#41745 main works cleanly. UPSTREAM.md updated to reflect this.

Compose changes:
- gemma-mtp-int8.yml: --max-num-seqs now ${MAX_NUM_SEQS:-4} env override.
  Three documented configs: max-num-seqs=4 + 98K (multi-tenant),
  max-num-seqs=2 + 170K (balanced), max-num-seqs=1 + 262K (single-stream
  full native max).

Doc updates:
- BENCHMARKS.md: 3 new rows (post-#41745 re-bench, 98K INT8 PTH, 262K
  INT8 PTH). Section header reframed.
- docs/UPSTREAM.md: PR #41745 row → 🟢 closed (overlay dropped). PR #40391
  row → 🟡 vendored + validated (was 🔴 NOT shippable).

Cross-rig signals to send upstream (separate follow-up): post a comment
on PR #40391 with our Ampere INT8 PTH validation alongside cferra's
sm_120 FP8 PTH validation. Two consumer architectures both confirming
the fix works.

- **docs(hardware): add Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (MoE) 3090 power-cap charts + comparison** ([ec27d75](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ec27d7594eadcad6a343fe4b4e3246f195b87eef))


Same 3090 (GPU 0, air-cooled), same engine (mainline llama.cpp), same
Q4-class quant (Q4_K_XL). Only the model changes: dense Qwen3.6-27B vs
A3B 35B (3B active per token).

Findings:

1. MoE shifts decode sweet spot 80W lower:
   - Dense decode: 290W → 0.111 TPS/W, SM 1380 MHz at sweet spot
   - A3B decode:   210W → 0.546 TPS/W, SM 1290 MHz at sweet spot
   Each token only activates 3B of 35B params on MoE → less compute per
   token → bandwidth-bound knee fires at lower power.

2. Prefill sweet spot is workload-determined, NOT model-determined:
   - Dense prefill: 250W → 3.633 TPS/W
   - A3B prefill:   250W → 9.865 TPS/W
   Both converge to same cap because prefill is compute-bound regardless
   of MoE routing.

3. Boost-clock plateau depends on workload AND model:
   - Dense decode: PLATEAU at 340-370W (SM 1560 MHz lock)
   - A3B decode:   NO PLATEAU (SM climbs smoothly 1875→1890→1890→1905)
   - Dense prefill: PLATEAU at 330-370W (SM 1605-1620)
   - A3B prefill:   PLATEAU at 340-370W (SM 1680-1710)
   Plateau auto-detection correctly flagged dense decode but not A3B
   decode — confirming firmware operating-point selection responds to
   compute pressure, not just to cap value.

Pareto annotation was at (800, 720) in upper-middle, overlapping with
the legend at upper-left and clipping behind it. Moved both annotations
to the empty right margin: sweet spot at (2350, 50), Pareto at (2350, 320).
Both arrows now point up-left to their respective stars; boxes are clear

- **docs(hardware): add 5090 clock-lock chart + Blackwell freq-cap section** ([119a5fa](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/119a5fa00db659ac5283540d70cea65257c4cbaa))


@apnar found a Pareto improvement over our prior 5090 power-cap sweet
spot by switching from power-cap to clock-lock methodology. The 5090
has a 400W minimum power cap (nvidia-smi -pl rejects below 400W on this
card), so the power-cap-sweep methodology is blind to the entire <400W
envelope. Clock-locking via nvidia-smi -lgc + -lmc has no minimum-power
floor and surfaces operating points the power-cap sweep can't reach.

Headline findings (1× 5090 air, Gemma-4-31B-AutoRound + MTP K=3,
decode-concurrent N=6):

  Power-cap sweet spot (prior):
    400W cap → 571 narr TPS, ~400W draw, 1.43 TPS/W

  Freq-cap peak efficiency (new):
    7001 mem / 1635 GPU MHz → 428 narr TPS, 211W draw, 2.025 TPS/W
    → 1.42× more efficient at 47% less power, for 25% lower TPS

  Freq-cap Pareto point (new):
    14001 mem / 2122 GPU MHz → 602 narr TPS, 314W draw, 1.92 TPS/W
    → strictly better than 400W power-cap: +5% more TPS at -22% less power

The 35-point sweep proves memory clock is the dominant TPS variable on
Blackwell decode — at 405 MHz mem (lowest tested), TPS caps at ~53
regardless of GPU clock; at 14001 MHz mem (stock max), TPS scales
through 800+ at GPU 3090 MHz.

Adds:
- docs/img/freq-cap-5090-gemma4.py + .png

- **docs(hardware): regen 3090 power-cap charts with SM clock + plateau evidence** ([9f77be7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9f77be791bced574965276d8271eaa28dc58f5a9))


Re-ran both 21-cap sweeps with the new sampling fields (commit ab2796d).
The boost-state plateau hypothesized in the prior captions is now directly
evidenced by the SM-clock data:

decode-single (~8m sweep):
  Caps 340/350/360/370W → SM 1560 MHz, draw 334W, TPS 34.66 — identical.
  Cap 380W → SM 1635 MHz, draw 361W, TPS 35.56 (plateau escape).

prefill-heavy (~6m sweep):
  Caps 330-370W → SM 1605-1620 MHz, draw 327W, TPS 1050 — identical.
  Cap 380W → SM 1665 MHz, draw 355W, TPS 1080 (plateau escape).

Throttle stays at 100% across the plateau in both modes — firmware *is*
power-capping, but the cap it enforces is its own internal voltage/clock
setpoint, not the user-set software cap. This makes the prior "we think
this is a firmware plateau" framing concrete: it's a boost-clock lock,
released only at the next cap step.

Chart annotations updated to reference SM-clock evidence directly.
HARDWARE.md cross-rig table rows for @noonghunna's rig refreshed with
new TPS numbers + SM clock annotation. Sweet spots unchanged (290W
decode / 250W prefill); the new data refines the explanation rather
than the conclusion.

- **docs(hardware): reconcile 230W vs 290W vs 330W sweet-spot story** ([a7a1d59](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a7a1d591d5154fb8c0822738ff66536f85ae9fb0))


The "230W is the sweet spot" lore was stale — it traces to coarse 3-cap-resolution
data. Dense 10W-resolution sweeps on this rig now show:

- 290W: actual air-cooled decode sweet spot (0.111 TPS/W)
- 330W: water-cooled sweet spot (per @syangsao 3-cap data)
- 230W: NOT a sweet spot — costs ~16% efficiency vs 290W; just a low-power cap

Add decode-concurrent N=4 row to cross-rig table (290W also peaks here on this rig,
matching decode-single — concurrency doesn't move the knee). Add per-workload-class
table showing decode at 290W vs prefill at 250W on the same card. Update vLLM engine
doc to match.

- **docs(hardware): @apnar prefill-heavy 5090 sweep — proves per-workload power ceiling** ([d5ef8c8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d5ef8c89d09c35b37ce10b6a85db63d374ebcf17))


Headline finding from @apnar's 4th + 5th sweeps in one day (disc #86):
- Decode N=8 (Gemma 4 + MTP): tops at 551W actual draw (vs 547W at N=4)
  → confirms decode is memory-bandwidth bound, not concurrency-limited
- Prefill-heavy (Qwen3.6 long-text): hits 599.98W actual draw at 600W cap
  → 99.997% cap-respect, full TDP saturation

Per-workload-class power ceiling on the 5090:
- Decode workloads: ~547-551W max (memory bandwidth limit, regardless of cap)
- Prefill workloads: ~600W (compute-bound, scales with TDP)

Both workload classes share efficiency knee at 400W cap (67% of stock TDP) —
that "60-85% of stock TDP" cross-rig pattern holds across workloads. But
absolute throughput behavior differs: decode at 600W gives only 4% more TPS
than at 400W (bandwidth ceiling); prefill at 600W gives 19% more TPS (compute
actually uses the watts).

Practical implication for 5090 deployments:
- Chat/IDE-agent: cap at 400W (huge efficiency win, ~5% TPS loss)
- RAG/long-context: leave at stock 600W (compute-bound, watts buy throughput)
- Mixed: 400W if chat-dominant; pure prefill loads suffer

New chart: docs/img/power-cap-5090-qwen36-prefill.png shows the curve with
the "599.98W actual at 600W cap" callout.

HARDWARE.md additions:
- 2 new BENCHMARKS rows for prefill-heavy 400W (sweet spot) + 600W (saturation)
- Inline embed of the prefill chart after the decode (Gemma 4 + MTP) chart
- New "Per-workload-class power ceilings" subsection with the cross-workload
  bottleneck table

Note on apnar's contribution: he ran 5 sweeps total today (50W resolution
v1, 50W after calibration fix v2, 10W canonical anchor v3, decode N=8
headroom probe v4, prefill-heavy compute-saturation test v5) — all on the
old token-bounded bench architecture before today's time-bounded redesign
shipped (his sweeps at 13-14 UTC, my time-bounded redesign at 18:15 UTC).
The cross-validation depth is rare — most cross-rig contributions stop at
one sweep.

- **docs(hardware): correct 3090 cooling class — air, not water** ([1f94478](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1f94478179f9fe4d1daff644a1cf1eb5f06cc0cc))


@noonghunna's rig is air-cooled (peak 76°C at 390W is air-typical;
water would be ~50-60°C). Earlier rows + chart caption were mislabeled
as water-cooled — that was an inference error on my part.

Updates:
- HARDWARE.md table rows: 3090 cooling water → air (3 rows)
- Chart caption: water-cooled → air-cooled, added GPU temp note
- Chart script subtitle/comments: water-cooled → air-cooled
- Refreshed PNG with corrected subtitle

Cross-rig context: we now have TWO air-cooled 1× 3090 anchor points
(@lamentofhighborne MTP build vs @noonghunna mainline) instead of one
air + one water. The "cooling-class delta" cross-rig comparison angle
is moot here — the build-class delta (MTP vs no-MTP) is what differs.
syangsao's 3-cap sparse data remains the only water-cooled 3090 anchor.

First-party data: water-cooled dual-3090 rig (GPU 0 used), 18-cap
sweep 200-390W on mainline llama.cpp + Qwen3.6-27B Q3_K_XL.

Findings:
- Sweet spot at 290W cap (0.111 TPS/W, 32.1 narr / 31.7 code)
- 290W is 78% of stock 370W TDP — fits cross-rig "60-85% of stock"
  pattern alongside 4090 (58%) and 5090 (67%) sweet spots
- Firmware boost-state plateau: caps 340-370W all draw identical
  ~334W actual (looks like a hardware ceiling but isn't)
- At 380W cap, actual draw escapes to 361W; at 390W cap, 388W
- Card temp peaked 75°C at 390W cap — water cooling has headroom

Mixed bench shapes during sweep:
- 200-210W: full bench (1+2 / 500+400 tokens) for higher-fidelity
  data at the throttled-cap region
- 220W: cold-cache narr biased (skipped), code retained
- 230-240W: quick bench (0+1 / 250+200, no warmup, cache warm
  from previous cap)
- 250-390W: quick bench with warmup=1 (1+1 / 250+200) for clean
  per-cap measurements

TPS values are wall-time throughput so directly comparable across
bench shapes. Caveat noted in chart caption.

BENCHMARKS row added for sweet spot + stock + max caps. Now have
charts for 3090 / 4090 / 5090 — completes the consumer-class
cross-rig anchor set.

Visualizes @laurimyllari's 15-cap 10W-resolution sweep from disc #62:
- Sweet spot at 260W cap (0.186 TPS/W)
- Workload-saturated: +8% TPS for +54% wattage going from 260W to 400W
- 4090's 450W stock TDP is well above the efficiency knee on this workload

Source script (docs/img/power-cap-4090-qwen36.py) parses raw data from
laurimyllari's attached log for reproducibility / future re-rendering.

Now have charts for 5090 + 4090. 3090 chart pending — will use first-party
data (water-cooled rig) once driver mismatch is resolved.

Visualizes @apnar's 21-cap 10W-resolution sweep from disc #86 with
three signals on one chart:
- Narrative TPS (peaks 619 at 510W cap)
- Code TPS (peaks 773 at 490W cap)
- Efficiency TPS/W (monotonic 1.43 → 1.10 from 400W → 600W)

Sweet-spot annotation at 400W (1.43 TPS/W). Red-shaded zone 530-600W
shows workload-saturation (~547W max actual draw regardless of cap,
not thermal throttle — GPU temp peaked 66°C).

Includes the source script (docs/img/power-cap-5090-gemma4.py) so
future contributors can regenerate or adapt the chart for other rigs.
Generated via uvx --from matplotlib --with numpy.

- **docs(engines): more honest vLLM GGUF status** ([2d9aa14](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2d9aa1483ccdc446a6e3609e86eb4010c08474fe))


Previous "⚠️ Limited (recent UD-IQ1_S support)" undersold the limitations.
vLLM's own docs lead with "highly experimental and under-optimized."

Specific limitations worth surfacing:
- Single-file GGUF only — multi-file (any large MoE) requires manual
  gguf-split merge first
- Tokenizer conversion unstable on large-vocab models (Qwen3.6's 200K)
- "May be incompatible with other features" per vLLM docs
- No published perf benchmarks vs HF safetensors

UD-IQ1_S support via PR #39471 (merged 2026-04-10) is the recent
positive change but doesn't address the structural limitations.

- **docs(engines): fix 12 corrupted table separators from ik_llama.cpp column add** ([8f5b924](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/8f5b92491a44e06873c9c8a252b6602589550043))


The script that added the ik_llama.cpp column in 0959206 had a
rstrip-then-append bug that produced `|---|---|---|---|------|`
(merging the last separator with the appended one) instead of the
correct `|---|---|---|---|---|---|` (six column separators for
the six-column tables).

GitHub still rendered the tables (markdown is permissive on
separator widths) but the row appeared visually narrower than
the header on some renderers and could mis-align in non-GitHub
markdown viewers.

Fix is a one-shot sed replace across all 12 affected tables:
hardware, weight quants, KV cache, spec-decode, MoE, distributed,
memory/KV cache, multimodal, structured output, model coverage,
API surface, cross-engine bug tracker.

Also fixes one stale text reference: "all four work" → "all five work"
in the Hardware support recommendation paragraph.

- **docs(engines): add ik_llama.cpp as 5th column to comparison matrix** ([0959206](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/09592065f5261f17d55efc2e053690552d148fbb))


ik_llama.cpp (Iwan Kawrakow's fork) materially differs from mainline
llama.cpp on three axes that matter for our stack:

1. **MTP merged on main** (Qwen + GLM-4.x) — vs mainline's open PR #22673
2. **Fused MoE kernels** for DeepSeek-R1 / Kimi (consumer-hardware optimized)
3. **IQ_K quant series** (IQ4_KT, IQ3_K_R4) + runtime quant repacking

Most matrix rows mirror llama.cpp (it's a fork inheriting the codebase);
overrides flag where ik_llama.cpp diverges. Added column to:
- Hardware support
- Quantization (weights + KV cache)
- Speculative decoding
- MoE features
- Distributed
- Memory / KV cache
- Multimodal
- Structured output / tool calling
- Model coverage
- API surface
- Cross-engine bug parity tracker (12 tables total)

Plus:
- 2 new TL;DR rows (MTP-without-PR-branch + DeepSeek/Kimi alternative)
- New Versions table row + positioning paragraph
- New Honest gaps section
- Added to specific shipped-model picks ("Qwen3.6-27B single-card with MTP")
- Added decision-tree alternative for "MoE just slightly over VRAM"
- Sources updated with ik_llama.cpp + Issue #1509 reference
- Maintenance note bumped from "four projects" to "five"

README link updated.

- **docs(hardware): add 5090 + Gemma 4 + MTP cross-rig anchor rows (apnar disc #86)** ([bef5701](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/bef57012a725fe8c5f0975ff531508826c5eb45e))


Three operating points from @apnar's full 21-cap 10W sweep:
- 400W (efficiency winner): 571 narr / 701 code, 1.429 TPS/W
- 510W (narr peak): 619 narr / 724 code, 1.215 TPS/W
- 600W (stock baseline): 601 narr / 757 code, 1.103 TPS/W

Cross-workload pattern emerges combining apnar's two 5090 sweeps:
both Qwen3.6-27B AutoRound and Gemma 4 31B + MTP land at the same
~400W efficiency sweet spot despite ~5× different absolute TPS scales.
Updated 5090 compute-saturation note to reflect this is workload-
independent on consumer-air-cooled 5090.

Hardware-physical ceiling for Gemma 4 + MTP at concurrency=4:
~547W actual draw, no thermal throttle (66°C peak). Above 530W
cap = wasted budget.

Validates the calibration fix shipped at 29e7de5: at 600W cap with
new logic (N=4 plateau-detected), TPS jumps from 499/616 (old N=6)
to 600/757 — pure calibration win, +20-25% same-cap TPS.

Comprehensive cross-engine comparison covering 11 dimensions:
- Versions + release cadence
- Hardware support (NVIDIA CC range, AMD, Apple, CPU)
- Quantization formats (weights + KV cache)
- Speculative decoding methods (MTP, EAGLE, DFlash, ngram, draft)
- MoE features (TP/EP, expert offload styles, router-aware caching)
- Distributed (TP/PP/EP/DP/disaggregated)
- Memory / KV cache features (paged, prefix cache, sparse, mamba)
- Multimodal (vision/audio/video/diffusion)
- Structured output / tool calling
- Model coverage for 2026 architectures
- API surface (HTTP/gRPC/Anthropic/OpenAI compat)

Plus:
- TL;DR pick-by-workload table
- Decision tree for new model deployment on consumer hardware
- Specific engine pick for each shipped model on club-3090
- Honest gaps section per engine
- Cross-engine bug parity tracker (Marlin pad, DeltaNet rollback,

- **docs: codify canonical power-cap-sweep command for cross-rig anchors** ([886b619](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/886b619cc45d3a5f26adeebb3ec78508ce856388))


Calibration fix in 29e7de5 + apnar's re-run on disc #86 surfaced that
the canonical anchor-data invocation needs to be more explicit. Two
risks: (1) default --step-size 10 is right but coarse-step suggestions
(--step-size 50) leave too few data points to find the knee, (2) without
--bench-runs 3, single-batch variance can produce 10-30% adjacent-cap
deltas that are noise rather than signal.

HARDWARE.md: adds full canonical command with all four flags (cooling,
load-mode, concurrency auto, bench-runs 3) plus rationale for each.
Explicitly notes --step-size 10 is the default and not to override
unless you know why.

CONTRIBUTING.md: bumps the inline example to the same canonical form.

Both composes added to master in 0d199a1 (#92) and 89c6862 (#96).
Adding the BENCHMARKS rows + CHANGELOG entry that those PRs left
to follow-up.

NVLink lift on DFlash paths now anchored cross-rig in BENCHMARKS:
- dual-nvlink-dflash: +17% narr / +16% code over same-rig PCIe baseline
- dual-nvlink-dflash-noviz: +17% / +17% (188K ctx, empirically determined)

CHANGELOG entry notes the qwen3_coder tool-parser sidecar gap (these
direct-cmd composes don't receive it, consistent with existing direct-cmd
pattern).

- **docs(benchmarks): @apnar 5090 Gemma 4 MTP + DFlash rows (disc #67)** ([98b0601](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/98b0601b6888b86116312f2b9df38e9f871b7521))


First single-5090 Gemma 4 data points on the matrix:
- gemma-mtp TP=1: 159.67/215.10 narr/code TPS, 27.5 GB VRAM, 32K ctx
- gemma-dflash TP=1: 150.40/261.06 narr/code TPS, 28.8 GB VRAM, 12K ctx

Both clear the 24 GB Ampere boot OOM (32 GB Blackwell envelope is
the unblock). +46-58% over @noonghunna 2x 3090 TP=2 baseline on
Gemma 4 (109/142 MTP, 95/168 DFlash) — single-card 5090 beats
dual-3090 on this model.

First patched-driver P2P cross-rig data point on the matrix. Closes
the experimental question raised in disc #70 about whether
[aikitoria/open-gpu-kernel-modules + Sam McLeod's vLLM cuda.py patch]
captures NVLink-class gains on dual-3090 PCIe rigs without NVLink hardware.

Same-rig controlled A/B on EPYC 7F52 + Arch:
- Unpatched baseline: 91 narr / 114 code (matches @danbedford dual.yml 89/115 within CV)
- Patched P2P:        93 narr / 125 code

Net: +2% narr / +9% code over PCIe baseline.

Vs @danbedford's NVLink hardware A/B (+15%/+15%), patched P2P captures:
- ~60% of NVLink's code gain
- ~13% of NVLink's narr gain

Asymmetric — confirms code workloads (spec-decode verify is heavily
cross-card matmul) are more bandwidth-sensitive than narr decode.

For ~95% of dual-3090 owners without NVLink, this is the empirical
"is patched P2P worth the maintenance overhead?" answer: small lift
on code, basically nothing on narr, vs custom kernel module + DKMS
build pipeline + signed-driver concerns. Reasonable contributor data
point but not a "you should all do this" call.

- **docs(upstream): note we filed cross-rig validation on vLLM PR #40391** ([e46f1e8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e46f1e8e03de6b0d882a95581fd73163594796d6))


Posted upstream feedback on Gemma 4 per-token-head KV bug:
- PR #40391 comment: structural confirmation of design choices via
  3 alternative-fix-shapes investigation (all fail in ways that
  validate this PR's full-package approach)
- Issue #40388: shorter pointer to the PR comment

Adds Ampere consumer + INT8 per-token-head as third cross-rig
validation point alongside @cferra's earlier Blackwell + FP8.
Hopefully unblocks the reviewer-stalled PR.

- **docs(gemma-4): int8_per_token_head on Ampere — Codex investigation verdict** ([1c2c156](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1c2c156003550b5b1b004c329461f7d7ba2588bb))


Codex's follow-up investigation 2026-05-06 verified that NEITHER our
spec-level overlay NOR PR #40391 worker-runtime is split-able into
a vendorable overlay:

1. Codex spec-level overlay boots with 247K-token KV pool BUT severe
   decode-TPS decay (turn-1 33 → turn-5 10, 30% retention). Root cause
   identified: vLLM's generic strided-view path is incompatible with
   standard attention's shape ordering when `page_size_padded` is set —
   NOT a dequant overhead as initially hypothesized.

2. PR #40391 is NOT just worker-side — its strict unifier still rejects
   without the model/attention spec changes that pre-pad Gemma 4 global
   layers to 1040-byte factor at spec level. Worker-only overlay
   attempted; failed at the original `unify_kv_cache_spec_page_size`
   NotImplementedError.

3. Hybrid (Codex generic unifier + PR worker view) boots but corrupts
   output on a basic Paris smoke test. Naive merge ruled out.

Net: int8_per_token_head on Gemma 4 + Ampere is upstream-blocked until
the full PR #40391 (model + attention spec + worker-runtime view
together) merges and rebuilds against current gemma4_mtp model class.

Reverted gemma-mtp.yml to bf16 KV default (32K ctx, 0.92 mem-util).
Local exploratory overlays preserved at:

  models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/vllm-perheadkv-hybridpage-fix/
  models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/vllm-pr40391-perheadkv/
  models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/vllm-gemma4-fp8-ampere/

…not committed (failed-experiment code), kept locally as reference for
future Codex iterations when PR #40391 lands or when a similar bug
surfaces on a different model.

Codex's full verdict memo committed at:
  models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/perheadkv-overlay-comparison.md

UPSTREAM.md row updated from "Open PR but workable" framing to "NOT
shippable as overlay" with the structural-cause explanation.

- **docs: surface host-build contributor flow + power-cap-sweep in README + CONTRIBUTING** ([9aa6cb2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9aa6cb2b0e93c8b45d33b00b368532d7055086ca))


Two minimal pointers added now that scripts are engine-agnostic:

- README.md: host-build invocation pattern + link to disc #88
- CONTRIBUTING.md: same + new bullet for power-cap-sweep.sh ask
  (anchors for cards we don't have yet — A5000/A6000, 4080, 5060
  Ti/5080, modded variants)

No structural changes — keeps the existing flow intact for vLLM-stack
users; just opens the door for non-Docker contributors who would have
been silently turned away before #87 / #88.

- **docs(benchmarks): add @lamentofhighborne 1× 3090 llama.cpp MTP row (#85)** ([68dbfaf](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/68dbfafe94148806a97025c1758bd6864454c1af))


First 1× 3090 cross-rig data point on llama.cpp PR #22673 MTP path,
on havenoammo's republished GGUF (UD-Q4_K_XL + Q8_0 MTP head).

Headline: 47.12 / 60.42 wall TPS narr/code at 131K ctx with q4_0 KV.

Two notable findings vs prior framing:

1. ctx ceiling on this path is **131K with q4_0 KV**, not the 64-80K we
   previously cited (which was based on q8_0 KV). q4_0 unlocks the long
   ctx that was blocking llama.cpp MTP adoption.

2. The recurrent 65-layer bug from froggeric's earlier MTP GGUF did NOT
   reproduce on havenoammo's UD GGUF. So the GGUF source matters —
   havenoammo's republish appears bug-free.

Surfaces our verify/soak harness engine-coupling — Issue #85.

- **docs(hardware): add @apnar's 5090 power-cap anchor + compute-saturation note** ([60d4df6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/60d4df6ce7a960c7ff6a38c78c6be85a55e4608c))


@apnar's 5090 (air-cooled, vLLM + Qwen3.6-27B-AutoRound) data on
disc #62 shows two anchors — 400W (peak efficiency on this workload)
and 575W (near-stock comparison). Critical finding: card maxes at
~430W actual draw regardless of cap because the workload is
compute-saturated for the 5090's compute envelope. Implication: the
knee will shift higher on larger models that actually use the 5090.

Replaces "5090 anchor pending" with the actual data + a note pointing
to the new dedicated discussion thread (disc #86 — Cross-rig power-cap
efficiency matrix) where future sweeps will land.

- **docs(upstream): correct Gemma 4 per-token-head KV row — upstream PR exists** ([eb9f955](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/eb9f9552832931d4cc5e2bdd0a9d21f18f739e80))


Earlier UPSTREAM.md row claimed "no upstream fix in flight" for Gemma 4 +
sub-bf16 KV. Wrong on closer search:

- Issue #40388 by @lisp19 (filed 2026-04-20) is the canonical bug report
  with exact root-cause diagnosis (head_dim 256 vs 512 + per-token-head
  scales breaking the 2:1 page-size ratio).
- PR #40391 by @lisp19 is open, mergeable, just blocked on reviewer.
  Cross-rig validated by @cferra on Blackwell sm_120 + fp8_per_token_head.

Our Codex-produced kv_cache_utils.py overlay is independent of #40391 and
takes a different approach (spec-level LCM/page_size_padded fallback vs
worker-side runtime padding). Both work; lisp19's is upstream-tracking.

Result of our validation 2026-05-06 on 2× 3090 + Gemma 4 + MTP +
int8_per_token_head: KV cache size 57,668 → 247,186 tokens (4.3×).
First Ampere consumer + int8_per_token_head data point (cferra's
confirmations are all Blackwell + fp8_per_token_head).

- **docs(gemma-4): document fp8 + int8 KV exploration on Ampere — both blocked** ([bb07eb5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/bb07eb59aec1c70f1748a43be51acbaccc1e2364))


2026-05-06 investigation outcomes for unblocking sub-bf16 KV on Gemma 4
+ Ampere consumer (TP=1 single-card boot or TP=2 ctx ceiling lift):

1. fp8_e5m2 (ChatGPT/Codex Path A overlay) — clears the
   attention.py:439 query_quant assertion + the fp8e4nv cache-update
   error, but exposes 2nd-order failure: Triton unified_attention
   requires 114 KB shared mem vs 100 KB hardware limit on sm_86 +
   Gemma 4's 512-dim head config. Kernel-tile tuning out of scope.
   Overlay preserved locally only (not committed since it doesn't boot).

2. fp8_e4m3 — Triton "fp8e4nv not supported in this architecture" on
   sm_86; hardware-bound (Ampere supports only fp8e4b15 / fp8e5 PTX).

3. int8_per_token_head — NotImplementedError at kv_cache_utils.py:1068
   (unify_kv_cache_spec_page_size). Per-head scales produce incompatible
   page geometry across Gemma 4's hybrid attention layers (full + SWA +
   DFlash drafter layers can't unify into one KV pool).

Net: bfloat16 is the only Ampere-shippable KV dtype on Gemma 4. Updated
both the dflash compose header and docs/UPSTREAM.md row to reflect the
broader "sub-bf16 KV blocked" framing (was "fp8 KV blocked"). gemma-mtp
single-card path remains upstream-blocked.

Re-test triggers narrowed to: (a) sm_86-aware Triton tile dispatch for
unified_attention; (b) hybrid-page-unification for per-head KV variants;
(c) Hopper fp8 backport to Ampere — none currently in flight upstream.

- **docs(gemma-4): empirical ctx ceilings + PR #41745 merge status** ([1038e5f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1038e5fc77f72f28c0900cf53a947e90f008b002))


Two related updates:

1. Empirical max-ctx ceilings on TP=2 BF16 KV, measured at boot:
   - 32K @ 0.92 → KV pool 38,339 tokens (shipped default)
   - 65K @ 0.95 → KV pool 57,668 tokens (DFlash, max practical)
   The 32K shipped default leaves significant headroom on the table.
   Documented env-override range in both gemma-dflash.yml and gemma-mtp.yml
   compose comments. fp8 KV would double these but is Ampere-blocked.

2. vLLM PR #41745 (Gemma 4 MTP) merged 2026-05-06 14:39 UTC at commit
   27e0057. Latest published nightly is from 06:08 UTC — pre-merge — so
   overlay drop is gated on the next nightly build (~2026-05-07 06:08 UTC).
   UPSTREAM.md row updated to "🟢 Merged, awaiting nightly" with the full
   cleanup recipe (image bump + overlay block removal + entrypoint trim
   + patches dir delete + re-bench).

- **docs(power): add cooling caveat — 388W stock requires liquid cooling** ([b15c5e1](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b15c5e1f33bee67ed17c9301e630f54af6d81827))


Air-cooled 3090s thermal-throttle to ~310-340W effective under sustained
decode load regardless of software cap, so the 388W→330W gap mostly
disappears for them. The 330W cap recommendation mainly benefits
liquid-cooled rigs that can actually sustain full board power.

Per follow-up to @syangsao thread — his 38 TPS at 388W is achievable
because of the Alphacool Eiswolf 2 360mm AIO; air-cooled users would
likely already be at 330W-equivalent without any cap.

- **docs(power): revise default cap 230W → 330W per @syangsao cross-rig data** ([2fe017f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2fe017f88dee7036184c6ee0e048c91c59754cea))


@syangsao's three-point sweep (230W/330W/388W stock) on 1× water-cooled 3090
+ llama.cpp + Qwen3.6 27B Q3_K_XL revealed 230W costs ~34% TPS (25 vs 38)
on this engine path — far larger than the "<10%" framing in prior docs. The
chunked_gated_delta_rule kernel is genuinely compute-bound on GDN-attention
models, so power cap throttles SM clocks ~linearly.

330W is the actual sweet spot: peak TPS/W efficiency, only ~5% TPS loss vs
388W stock, and 388W is *less* efficient than 330W on this kernel mix.

Updates docs/HARDWARE.md power section with the cross-rig data table and
flips the recommended default. docs/engines/VLLM.md gets a smaller note
flagging the engine-specific difference.

Per https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/80#issuecomment-4388578201
— actual VRAM at 100K ctx is 15,596 MiB, not the ~14.6 GB I rounded down to
in the initial row.

- **docs(benchmarks): add @efschu 2× Tesla V100 16GB row (first sm_70 Volta data)** ([9212c60](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9212c606e07c0cb4f52ea5bcf259e987cb184630))


@efschu ran a 2× Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB rig — vLLM blocked because V100 is
compute capability 7.0 and vLLM needs ≥7.5. Fell back to llama.cpp via
am17an's PR #22673 (the same MTP path we evaluated 2026-05-05) with a
custom-built llama-server docker.

Numbers (Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-Q4_K_M-GGUF + --spec-type mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3):
  - narrative: 49.96 wall TPS (CV 3.0%) — 2.4× our llamacpp/default 21 TPS
  - code:      62.46 wall TPS (CV 3.6%) — 3.0× our llamacpp/default 21 TPS
  - VRAM 14.6 / 16 GB at -c 100000 (lots of headroom; he's gone to 100K)
  - All 7 verify-stress checks PASS including 90K NIAH (Cliff 2 territory)

Side-finding: PR #22673 works on V100 (sm_70). Yesterday's club-3090
investigation flagged it as 'NOT a recommendation' for our 3090 audience
on tradeoff grounds (custom build, ctx ceiling, n_parallel=1, no vision)
— but for V100 owners specifically the calculus inverts because vLLM
isn't available on that hardware class anyway. Cross-rig data validates
the path is functional on Volta.

First non-Ampere/Ada/Blackwell GPU class on the matrix.

- **docs(benchmarks): @danbedford 2× 3090 cross-rig matrix (6 benches, controlled PCIe vs NVLink)** ([6e57215](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/6e572156883fe2d5a291922307346b526b930525))


@danbedford ran a comprehensive 6-bench sweep on his 2× 3090 + NVLink rig
(230W cap, image nightly-01d4d1ad3 = v7.72.2 stack):

  - dual-nvlink-turbo  (NVLink, TQ3)   102.34 / 133.98  [#69]
  - dual-turbo         (PCIe, TQ3)     91.58 / 120.00   [#73]
  - dual-nvlink        (NVLink, fp8)   102.09 / 131.59  [#74]
  - dual-dflash        (PCIe, FP16)    86.62 / 141.02   [#75]
  - dual-dflash-noviz  (PCIe, FP16)    88.31 / 142.79   [#76]
  - dual               (PCIe, fp8)     89.24 / 114.57   [#77]

This is the FIRST controlled PCIe-vs-NVLink A/B on a single rig — same
hardware, image, Genesis pin, only NCCL_P2P_LEVEL differs. Surfaces an
important correction:

  NVLink lift on dual.yml          : +15% narr / +15% code
  NVLink lift on dual-turbo.yml    : +11% narr / +12% code

The earlier "+58% narr / +56% code" framing in JusefPol's NVLink row
conflated NVLink-lift with v7.72.2-lift (his comparison baseline was
2026-04-29 dual.yml at 69/89 on the older image). On a strictly
v7.72.2-controlled comparison the NVLink lift is ~12-15%, not ~58%.

Adds 5 new BENCHMARKS rows + updates the existing dual-nvlink-turbo
row with v7.72.2-rebench numbers (the original row carried a
"re-bench welcomed" trigger when we landed PR #65).

Side-finding: dual-dflash code TPS (141) on his PCIe matches @lolren's
142 as the highest measured code TPS on club-3090 to date.

102.96 narr / 103.09 code wall TPS at max_model_len=90000 (forced down from

First cross-rig data on the v7.72.2 uplift (PR #59). lolren ran
canonical bench.sh against three dual-card variants on an AMD Ryzen 9
5950X + 64GB RAM rig with both 3090s power-capped at 250W.

Headline finding — dual.yml on the new nightly (01d4d1ad3) gives
+30% narr / +32% code over @noonghunna's 2026-04-29 baseline (69/89 on
older image). Confirms the v7.72.2 throughput dividend extends cross-rig.

Three rows:
  - dual.yml         89.78 / 117.60 (CV 3.3%/2.0%) — v7.72.2 uplift confirmation
  - dual-dflash.yml  87.10 / 142.0  (CV 2.9%/2.7%) — older image
  - bounded-thinking 64.86 / 64.96  (CV 0.1%)      — MTP-disabled-suspected anomaly

The bounded-thinking row is tracked as an anomaly: near-identical
narr/code TPS + CV 0.1% suggests MTP was inactive (older nightly-7a1eb8ac2
pre-PN35 path may have silently dropped spec-decode for this variant).
Asked lolren for re-test on the latest nightly to confirm.

- **docs(upstream): track llama.cpp MTP PR #22673 + non-adoption rationale (#64)** ([#64](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/64) by @noonghunna)


am17an's MTP support PR for llama.cpp is unmerged but functional. Benched
locally on 1× 3090 (2026-05-05) at +34% narrative TPS over same-config
baseline (22.83 → 30.69 with --spec-draft-n-max 3, ~57% accept rate).

Documenting in the upstream tracker as 🟡 Open with explicit "NOT a
club-3090 recommendation yet" framing so future contributors don't ship
this as default or opt-in without revisiting the four blockers:
  1. PR unmerged — adopting forces a custom build per cross-rig user
  2. q8_0 KV caps context at ~64-80K (current default ships 262K)
  3. MTP forces n_parallel=1 — kills llamacpp/concurrent.yml
  4. RDson MTP GGUF doesn't bundle mmproj — vision regression

Audience analysis: max single-stream TPS users already have vllm
dual-turbo (170 TPS, 5× faster); llama.cpp single-card users picked it
specifically for 262K + cliff-immune + vision + concurrent. MTP
regresses 3 of those 4 for +34% — bad trade.

Re-evaluate when (a) PR merges, (b) q4_0 KV variant recovers ≥128K ctx,
(c) cross-rig validation on additional 3090s, (d) NIAH + coherence pass.

Adds a "Where to file what" table to CONTRIBUTING.md before the
"Process for non-trivial changes" section. Codifies the convention
that bug-shaped problems (logs, tracebacks, report.sh dumps) belong
in issues, while design/welcome/uncertain questions belong in
discussions.

Motivated by accumulating log-heavy comments in discussions
(notably disc #51 5090 NVFP4 debug, disc #33 k8v4 exploration)
that would have been more discoverable as issues. Issues have
state machines (open/closed, labels, assignees) and proper search
surface that discussions don't. Maintainers may now ask folks to
fork bug-shaped pieces into issues with a cross-link back.

@lexhoefsloot's venv-vs-Docker bisect on the same Proxmox host
(kernel 6.17.2-pve, default-runtime: nvidia, identical config)
proves the asyncio crash is bounded to the Docker image × Proxmox
container runtime interaction:

- Native venv (pip install vllm==0.20.1) launches cleanly, runs
  TP=2 + Lorbus AutoRound + turboquant_3bit_nc + 4-stream concurrent
  at 170-195 tok/s aggregate over 200K context end-to-end
- Docker image (vllm/vllm-openai:nightly-7a1eb8ac2…) crashes at
  uvloop.run() at the same host

Updates:
- Section header now mentions "workaround: native venv"
- Top callout cites the venv-works datapoint with cross-link
- Eliminations table extended with three new ❌ rows: kernel 6.17.x
  ruled out, vLLM-as-package ruled out, Proxmox-at-large ruled out.
  Sole remaining candidate is now the Docker image × Proxmox
  container runtime interaction.
- "What this means for you" path #2 now leads with the concrete
  venv recipe (python3 -m venv + pip install vllm==0.20.1) rather
  than parking the issue. Genesis can apply against the venv via
  the same apply_all script.
- Upstream filing target is now NVIDIA Container Toolkit (since
  Proxmox uses it for GPU passthrough) instead of generic Proxmox
  forum. Tighter narrowing.

- **docs(hardware): note SM86 structural ~70% TG drop at 131K (cross-rig)** ([eb5cd70](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/eb5cd708c3899953ecd9bb9852bd5825609b0799))


Independent cross-rig measurement from sztlink/turboquant-cuda-bench
(IQ4_NL repro 2026-04-27) shows SM86 (RTX 3090) hits −71% TG drop at
131K context with q8_0/turbo4 KV vs −54% on SM89 (RTX 4090) for the
same model+KV config. Their conclusion: "SM86 has a weaker warp
dispatch path for the turbo4 dequant kernel. The degradation is
architectural, not model-specific."

Implication for users: even when VRAM fits (no Cliff 1/2 firing), SM86
single-stream TG above ~32K-65K pays a structural per-token rate tax
not fixable by KV format choice. Frames the existing "switch to
llama.cpp at >60K" recommendation in SINGLE_CARD.md more concretely —
it's partly about VRAM cliffs and partly about this dispatch-rate
cliff.

Source originally surfaced by @lkaupp on
ggml-org/llama.cpp#20969 (3090 -71% report); confirmed on SM89
(-54%) by sztlink reproduction.

Cross-rig data only — no measurement on our specific stack to confirm
the magnitude. Treat as a hardware-class hint, not a precise number.

Three additions across docs/ that came out of today's reply trail:

1. NEW docs/CONTAINER_RUNTIMES.md — non-Docker / non-bare-metal
   environmental notes. Captures:
   - Soft-warn pattern (setup.sh docker check is now non-load-bearing
     after 2f8ed19, launch.sh / switch.sh keep hard check)
   - Podman / Podman Compose env override (COMPOSE_BIN already supported)
   - microk8s integration story — open invitation for @apnar to PR a
     manifest example after their 5090 + 3090 Ti benches
   - Proxmox VE 8.x / kernel 6.17.x asyncio crash class — full
     elimination trail from #49 (Genesis ruled out, torch.compile ruled
     out, multiproc ruled out, default-runtime: nvidia ruled out, --init
     ruled out, vLLM upstream ruled out via my Probe B reproduction).
     Verdict: environmental, parked. Re-check triggers listed.

2. docs/HARDWARE.md — added "Note for WSL2 / Windows users" covering
   TDR class diagnosis from #50 (RossNE99). Concrete PowerShell registry
   edit (TdrDelay=60s) + three escalating fix paths + WSL2-specific
   gotchas (pin_memory auto-off, host RAM for paged load). Plus a
   pointer to CONTAINER_RUNTIMES.md for non-Docker users.

3. docs/CLIFFS.md — refined the "rig-class caveat" callout to point at
   CONTAINER_RUNTIMES.md for the full Proxmox elimination trail (vs
   inline summary).

These are observation notes for users hitting environmental issues that
aren't club-3090 bugs. Not recipes for non-default runtime setups
(those need cross-rig validation we don't have CI for).

@lexhoefsloot's bisect on club-3090#49 surfaced that the v7.66 baseline
my CLIFFS.md called "known good" actually crashes on his rig
(3× 3090 / Proxmox VE / Debian 12 / kernel 6.17.2 / default-runtime:
nvidia / dual-turbo + override-pve compose) with an uvloop event-loop
trace BEFORE engine initialization. The crash:

- predates v7.66 (asyncio bug exists at fc89395 too)
- is independent of GENESIS_ENABLE_P87 (P87=0 doesn't fix it)
- masks-then-fires across the v7.66..v7.69 range (PN30 marker
  collisions on intermediate commits)

The v7.66/v7.69 stability verdict still holds on the rig class it was
measured on (bare-metal Ubuntu 2× 3090 PCIe, default Docker runtime)
but isn't a universal claim. Adding a callout near the top of the pin
status section so future readers landing on a non-baseline rig
understand "known good" is environment-conditional.

@lexhoefsloot's 3× 3090 setup uses CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2 to pin TP=2

pattern wasn't in MULTI_CARD.md — only the TP-table cell mentioning
"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1" for the 3-card case.

Added a "Picking which cards to use on awkward counts" subsection right
after the valid-TP table covering:

- nvidia-smi topo -m interpretation
- Connectivity classes ranked for TP allreduce
  (NV# > PIX > PXB > PHB > SYS)
- When same-switch (PIX) actually matters (server-class +

- **docs(benchmarks): walk back PFlash "shippable" framing — TTFT + NIAH ≠ full validation (#230, #231)** ([ccac1ff](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ccac1ff1751ce5b80c1d635e6e88d0a8294b0a6e))


Self-correction. The PFlash bench from ebca0c8 measured compression-phase
TTFT + NIAH key+answer retention at 16K-131K source. I framed that as
"shippable for ≤131K" — that's overclaiming.

What "shippable" requires (and other composes are held to):
- End-to-end TTFT + decode pipeline (we measured PFlash phase only)
- Long-context QA accuracy (RULER, LongBench multi-needle, multi-task) —
  NOT HumanEval+ / LCB v6 because those have <2K-token prompts and
  PFlash's compression path wouldn't even engage
- verify-stress.sh 7/7
- SOAK_MODE=continuous
- Multi-turn compression stability

None of those have been measured. The current evidence is directional
(strong on TTFT, strong on synthetic NIAH retention), not validated.

Updated BENCHMARKS row to:
1. Reframe "shippable" → "compression-phase result" + estimated end-to-end
2. Add explicit "What we have NOT validated" gate table — same gates we
   apply to every compose (verify-stress, soak, etc.)
3. Note that HE+/LCB don't apply to PFlash because of prompt-length
   mismatch; long-context QA harness (RULER) is the right next investment

Tracked at task #231: PFlash full validation gate. Substantial work — needs
new harness setup, not just another flag flip on existing benches.

- **docs(benchmarks): PFlash long-context bench — 131K source ceiling on 1× 3090 (#230)** ([ebca0c8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ebca0c8921293b156fffc338c3aee708621384ac))


Closes task #230. Measured PFlash NIAH compression at 16K-260K source
contexts on 1× 24 GB / 3090 single-card.

Result: PFlash works flawlessly up to 131K source. Compresses 131,068
tokens to 6,524 (5%) in 10.8s with NIAH key + answer both retained.
Vanilla llama.cpp pp131072 takes ~257s per Luce's published numbers,
so PFlash alone is ~24× faster at this context. End-to-end TTFT
(PFlash + target prefill on 6.5K) would be ~12-13s vs ~257s = ~20×.

Above 131K, drafter ephemeral forward-pass tensors (K_curr/V_curr/Q_last
at full sequence length) exceed 24 GB. K-cache quantization
(--pflash-k-type q8_0) doesn't help — the failing allocs are
forward-pass not cache, confirmed by separate bench at 200K/260K with
identical OOM at the same layer numbers.

@weicj's PR #78 claim of 24K → 262K dual-GPU phase split is neither
refuted nor reproduced. Their setup was 2× 22 GB Ti with target also
loaded co-resident on one card; the "24K" was target+drafter
combined. Our 131K is drafter-alone on 24 GB. Reproducing 262K
specifically would require investigation of their drafter config
(chunk_size, lookahead, BSA window) — drafter activation footprint
at 200K+ is the binding constraint regardless of GPU count.

Practical recommendation for 24 GB / 3090 single-card users: PFlash
is shippable for source contexts ≤ 131K. The ~24× TTFT speedup is
genuine and quality holds. Above 131K, fall back to vanilla llama.cpp
prefill or wait for upstream drafter optimizations.

Adds:
- BENCHMARKS.md "PFlash long-context compression on 1× 3090" subsection
  with full per-context table + drafter ceiling explanation
- results/lucebox-pflash-niah-20260504-150321/ (BF16 K cache run)
- results/lucebox-pflash-niah-q8k-20260504-150600/ (q8_0 K cache run)

This closes our active investigation of the Luce surface — three
benches done (DFlash same-card 73.97 mean, K8V4 same-card 74.68 mean,
PFlash compression ceiling 131K). Recommendation surface narrows to:
PFlash at ≤131K is the one piece of Luce that beats vLLM dual.yml on
TTFT for that workload class.

- **docs(benchmarks): K8V4 result + P2P-CNS finding on lucebox-hub dual-GPU (#229)** ([e78eaa1](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e78eaa1148af83566753d2ffb1c66fc1cbf2aba5))


K8V4 same-card bench (-ctk q8_0 -ctv q4_0): 74.68 mean tok/s vs 73.97
default KV — basically identical (+1%). KV-format optimization doesn't
help at HumanEval-scale (<150-tok prompts × 128-tok gen) where the KV
pool isn't the bottleneck. Asymmetric quant available via PR #56/#54
(merged 2026-04-28 in lucebox-hub).

P2P-CNS finding (more important): the dual-GPU split bench from
cb089e1 ran on a chipset that reports "Chipset Not Supported" for
GPU↔GPU peer access (PHB topology, common consumer-board limitation).
The lucebox-hub split path requires CUDA P2P for direct draft-feature
transfers; without it, falls back to host-staging copies (CPU↔GPU
bouncing). The +1.7% we observed is therefore NOT a fair test of the
split's value — it's measuring same-card vs same-card-with-host-staging
overhead.

@weicj's published 51.86 tok/s on dual 2080 Ti 22GB (PR #80) presumably
ran with P2P available. Our negative result on PHB-only consumer boards
is rig-specific, not a refutation of the technique. Updated BENCHMARKS
row to reflect this honestly.

Setup gotcha now documented in BENCHMARKS: check `nvidia-smi topo -p2p r`
before configuring --target-gpu / --draft-gpu. NVLink-bonded setups
would typically expose P2P (cross-rig confirmation needed on lucebox
specifically; @JusefPol's NVLink win was on vLLM TP=2, not lucebox).

First cross-engine bench on this stack against the lucebox-hub DFlash dual-GPU
split (PR #80 from @weicj, merged 2026-05-04). Test: HumanEval 10 prompts ×
n_gen=128 on Qwen3.5-27B Q4_K_M target + z-lab DFlash draft.

Result: dual-GPU split is essentially a no-op on 24 GB / 3090.

  Same-card baseline (target + draft on GPU 0):  73.97 tok/s mean (range 52.7–108.7)
  Dual-GPU split (--target-gpu 0 --draft-gpu 1): 75.24 tok/s mean (range 54.2–110.0)
  Delta:                                          +1.7% (within run-to-run noise)

AL (6.39) and accept (41.3%) identical between phases — same draft, same prompts.

Why this matches expectation in retrospect: PR #80's split frees draft VRAM from
competing with target activation budget. On 22 GB cards (where @weicj measured
51.86 tok/s) target Q4 (~16 GB) + draft (~3.5 GB) + KV genuinely fight for the
budget. On 24 GB cards there's already 4 GB headroom, so the bottleneck the split
addresses isn't binding. Peer-copy overhead from --draft-feature-mirror is
roughly canceled by the freed budget.

Implication: don't ship lucebox-hub dual-GPU as a 24 GB-class default. The
51.86 tok/s on dual 2080 Ti 22GB result still holds for tighter-VRAM Ampere.

PFlash phase-split (PR #78) is a separate, untested question — that's about
long-context prefill compression (24K → 262K passing NIAH), not decode TPS.
Tracked at task #230 if pursued. Today's DFlash-decode result doesn't refute
or confirm the PFlash long-context story.

Adds:
- BENCHMARKS.md "Cross-engine — Luce DFlash (lucebox-hub) on Qwen3.5-27B"
  subsection with both phases' numbers and the calibrated framing

- **docs(benchmarks): add @JusefPol's 2× 3090 + NVLink dual-nvlink row (#29, #31)** ([017d0d2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/017d0d2c2009ddd15ec50395e1947d52562e4747))


First NVLink cross-rig data on the repo. dual-nvlink.yml on JusefPol's
i7-11700K rig with 4× NVLink-bonded RTX 3090s gets 108.81 narr / 138.55
code TPS — +58%/+56% vs our PCIe-only dual.yml baseline (69/89).

NVLink's win at this scale isn't bandwidth (a 27B model's per-layer
allreduce is small) — it's latency. PCIe adds ~30-50µs over NVLink per
NCCL call; at 100 tok/sec × 2 streams that's 6-10ms/sec NVLink saves.
Compounds at multi-stream.

Validation: verify-stress 7/7 PASS (incl. 91K needle), v2 continuous
soak PASS (5 sessions × 5 turns, 0 MiB growth, 100% TPS retention).
MTP n=3 with 65-98% per-position accept.

- **docs(lucebox): record PRs #78 + #80 — dual-GPU PFlash + DFlash split shipped (May 2026)** ([dec0f22](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/dec0f22dac051c96b38a31b7245020f0736025c9))


Two @weicj PRs merged that change the lucebox-hub serving topology:

- PR #78 (PFlash phase-split, merged 2026-05-02) — --pflash-gpu flag,
  persistent pflash_daemon. Validation: passing NIAH source ctx 24K →
  262K (10.7× over single-card co-resident) on dual RTX 2080 Ti 22 GB.
- PR #80 (DFlash target/draft split, merged 2026-05-04) — --target-gpu /
  --draft-gpu flags. Validation: 51.86 tok/s HE 10-prompt, AL 7.09,
  44.3% accept on Qwen3.5-27B Q4 target + z-lab DFlash draft.

This is heterogeneous spec-decode (each model on its own card), not
weight-sharded TP. Removes the single-card co-residency limit that was
the binding blocker for 2× 3090 users (target + draft + KV all
competing for 24 GB → 65K max_ctx ceiling).

Updated:
- docs/UPSTREAM.md — Luce DFlash section gains a "🆕 Dual-GPU split
  landed" subsection with both PR links + @weicj's measured numbers.
  PFlash row status icon flipped from 🟡 to 🟢; "Re-evaluate" criteria
  reworked to focus on reproducing the 262K NIAH claim on 2× 3090.

- docs/engines/LLAMA_CPP.md — added "🆕 Dual-GPU split" subsection
  under the existing DFlash recipe with the new flag-based recipe and
  carry-over caveat (Qwen3.6-27B draft still under training; the
  benefit applies primarily to Qwen3.5-27B + DFlash today).

Memory updates (gitignored, not in this commit):
- pflash_future_exploration.md — type=project, status flipped from
  "co-residency blocker" to "co-residency blocker addressed via
  dual-GPU; bench task #229 queued"
- pflash_x_bounded_thinking_intersection.md — added 2026-05-04 update
  noting the new dual-GPU path and that the parked exploration is
  more concrete now

Bench tracked at task #229 (queued, not executed yet — these PRs are
hours old as of this commit).

- **docs(sglang): refresh per-engine + comparison pages — DFlash + MTP native upstream as of May 2026** ([ecc2d74](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ecc2d747aea7d7c0e06aaacae4e6bbbfbe1c3b40))


The historical "currently blocked" framing is partially out-of-date. SGLang
upstream has moved since we last tested:

- DFlash spec-decode: native, recent (z-lab confirmed --speculative-algorithm
  DFLASH; Qwen3.6-27B draft published at z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash)
- MTP: native, first-class for Qwen3-Next family per LMSYS Jul 2025 blog
- TurboQuant: WIP only (Issue #21618, not merged)
- Marlin pad-sub-tile-n fix (the binding INT4 + TP=2 boot blocker): status
  unknown — needs re-test on current SGLang main

Updated:
- models/qwen3.6-27b/sglang/README.md — full rewrite. New TL;DR table with
  per-feature status + a 4-step re-test plan: (1) smoke-boot AutoRound INT4
  + TP=2 with fp8/q4 KV (NOT TurboQuant — WIP), (2) verify-stress 7/7 if
  boots, (3) add DFlash spec-decode (preferred over MTP — higher accept
  rate + z-lab actively maintains SGLang integration), (4) ship as
  docker-compose.dual.yml if competitive vs vllm dual-dflash.yml. Watch list
  now anchored to specific upstream issues.

- docs/engines/README.md — comparison table row + cons section + "How to
  choose" entry refreshed to reflect "re-test pending" not "blocked."
  Specific re-test steps inlined; full plan cross-referenced to the
  per-engine page.

Status of physical work: re-test queued as task #227, not yet executed.
The decision tree in the README will let any contributor with current
SGLang main attempt the boot. If a cross-rig contributor reports a clean
boot, that's the green light to bench properly.

- **docs(structured-cot): soften Phase 3 framing per Codex v2-prompt validation** ([011d4cc](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/011d4cc37111dcb857338684faaa57a7bce2a717))


Codex's response to docs/diagnostics/grammar-design-llm-prompt-v2.md (also
gitignored) flagged three specific overclaims in the Phase 3 narrative:

1. "DeepSeek wins by +1 net" (combined +0.47pp = 1 problem on n=214) —
   below noise floor; the defensible claim is "doesn't lose combined
   accuracy while improving LCB v6 by 4pp = 2 problems on n=50."

2. "PROMPT_TERSE doesn't win at scale (−10 net)" — supported at the
   aggregate, but PT still rescues HE/151 and ties DeepSeek on the
   6-problem cluster. Right framing is "lacks long-tail reliability,"
   not "prompting never helps."

3. "HE/151 is the universal hard regression — a class no compact grammar
   shape can fit" — one example is weak evidence of a failure class.
   A different grammar shape (e.g. one with explicit final-validation)
   might plausibly rescue it; that's a future research question.

All three reframings landed in:
- docs/STRUCTURED_COT.md (4 places: Phase 3 ship-decision section,
  numbered findings, ship-decision rationale, PROMPT_TERSE caveat,
  HE/151 discussion)
- CHANGELOG.md 2026-05-04 entry
- models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/docker-compose.bounded-thinking.yml
  docstring (Phase 3 numbers section)

The core ship decision doesn't change — DeepSeek is still the recommended
grammar in bounded-thinking.yml. What changes is the justification: from
"+1 net combined win" to "preserved HE+ accuracy + gained LCB headroom,
which is the most defensible per-workload posture." The latter is the
honest read of n=214 evidence.

Codex's check-scratchpad grammar candidate (PLAN + STATE + NOTE/CASE +
mandatory CHECK + VERDICT) was already committed at
tools/grammar-eval/codex-check-scratchpad.gbnf as a hard-slice candidate
for future bench. Not shipping as a default; falsifiable test plan is
parked for if/when bounded-thinking research reopens.

- **docs(cliffs/hardware): ground Cliff 2 + TQ3 explanations in published literature** ([9b370f5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9b370f5ab1ab24bfc0ff6a5a96022cdc3e093606))


Adds arxiv citations to the Cliff 2 mechanism (CLIFFS.md) and the
TurboQuant KV format (HARDWARE.md), with a new "Academic references"
section in CLIFFS.md gathering all relevant papers in one place.

Headline finding: PerfMamba (arxiv 2511.22849) directly documents the
Cliff 2 mechanism in the parent architecture. At seq 2048, Mamba-2's
SSM consumes 33.5% more memory than Mamba-1 due to "block-wise state
materialization" — the same pattern Qwen3-Next inherits via Gated
DeltaNet. Activation peak scales as O(γ·D·N·L). That's the formal
scaling we'd been describing empirically.

What the literature doesn't cover (and is club-3090's contribution):
the activation-peak interaction with KV quantization format choice
(TQ3 vs fp8) and the per-VRAM-class budget consequences for consumer
Ampere deployments. PerfMamba describes the mechanism; we describe
the application-side trade-offs.

Citations added:
- arxiv 2511.22849 (PerfMamba) — Cliff 2 root mechanism
- arxiv 2504.19874 (TurboQuant ICLR 2026) — TQ3 KV technique

- **docs: cross-reference TQ3→fp8 KV swap from CLIFFS, DUAL_CARD, dual-turbo.yml + CHANGELOG record (#47)** ([129a4f4](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/129a4f42f4e3a1eab64abcdf6a444937b566c353))


The 20 GB Ampere finding from @efschu was already in HARDWARE.md (commit
124f08c) but not cross-referenced from the surfaces a user lands on first
when hitting the symptom. This commit closes the gap:

- docs/CLIFFS.md — new "KV format choice tunes the boundary" subsection
  under Cliff 2 root-cause. Generalizes from efschu's specific 20 GB finding
  to the principle: variant matrix is per-card-budget × KV-format-tradeoff
  aware; shipped defaults are tuned for 24 GB / 3090; users on different
  VRAM classes may need to override --kv-cache-dtype.

- docs/DUAL_CARD.md — dual-turbo picker row gets a "20 GB Ampere users:
  override TQ3 → fp8_e5m2; see HARDWARE.md + #47" inline pointer.

- models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/docker-compose.dual-turbo.yml — comment
  block above the --kv-cache-dtype line documenting the rationale, the
  swap rule, and the cross-link to HARDWARE.md.

- CHANGELOG.md — records the lesson as a stack-level finding so it's
  discoverable in repo history. Notes future work on KV_FORMAT env knob
  + preflight in #219.

- **docs(hardware): 20 GB Ampere TP=2 needs fp8_e5m2 KV, not TQ3 (#47)** ([124f08c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/124f08c7ceaf400965622c3038e851a1d62365b4))


Adds a new note under "sub-24 GB cards" explaining the TQ3-vs-fp8 KV trade
flip on 20 GB cards. Cross-rig validation by @efschu (2× 3080 modded 20 GB,
PCIe x4/x8, 250W cap):

- dual-turbo.yml as shipped (turboquant_3bit_nc) → Cliff 2 fires at 90K
- Override to --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e5m2 → verify-stress 7/7 PASS, full
  257K-token needle test passes at 90% depth, bench 82.4/107.9 TPS

The mechanism: TQ3's activation peak during DeltaNet GDN forward is ~1 GB/
card heavier than fp8. On 24 GB / 3090 the per-card budget absorbs this
(TQ3's smaller KV pool → more concurrency wins). On 20 GB cards after
TP=2 split, the activation peak exceeds budget and Cliff 2 fires at 90K
single-prompt. fp8_e5m2's larger per-token bytes are the correct trade
on this hardware sub-class.

Cross-link: #47.

- **docs(benchmarks): add @snoby's 2× 4090 dual-dflash-noviz row (#46)** ([fc4c061](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/fc4c061be1298124e2c144c7143b308eee4f57bb))


First non-3090 cross-rig data. 2× 4090 PCIe (GPUs 2,3 of a 5-GPU rig)
on docker-compose.dual-dflash-noviz.yml gets 92.55 narr / 148.99 code
TPS — +17% across the board vs same compose on 2× 3090 (78/127).

Notable rig-specific gotcha worth flagging: had to drop max-model-len
from 200K → 180K to clear engine pre-check (boot OOM at 200K). Same
compose, same vLLM image SHA, same KV format, same DFlash draft —
4090s lose 20K ctx vs 3090s. Likely candidates: driver 535+ memory
overhead on Ada, PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF interaction, power cap
profile differences. Pending investigation in #37 / #46 thread.

- **docs: align bug-report + FAQ + MULTI_CARD with report.sh --full / --soak** ([b859630](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b85963033aa62465a0c75a911d7ce394be52a098))


After shipping report.sh --full / --soak / --stress flags in 8a29b95, the
bug report flow + troubleshooting guidance still pointed at older patterns.
Updated:

- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml — replaced single-flag suggestion
  with a "pick the flag that matches your bug" decision table:
    - boot crash / wrong output / tool-call regression → --verify (~2 min)
    - OOM mid-conversation / agentic cliff → --soak (~25 min) — only test
      that catches Cliff 2b
    - TPS regression / cross-rig perf → --bench (~5 min)
    - not sure / capture everything → --full (~35 min)

- docs/FAQ.md "Found a bug — what should I include?" — replaced the generic
  "verify-full.sh output" note with the same flag decision table; updated
  the troubleshooting-ladder pointers to use --verify (boot path) and
  --full (multi-card TQ3+Genesis intersection bugs).

- docs/MULTI_CARD.md cross-rig contribution callouts (×2) — recommended
  command upgraded from --bench to --full (or --bench fallback if soak
  time-budget is tight, with explicit caveat that --bench skips Cliff 2b).

- **docs(benchmarks): add Rig column for cross-rig contributions** ([d8e7f73](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d8e7f73eb281ea62771b38458429d14271bd6427))


Restructure BENCHMARKS.md so every measured row carries an explicit
Rig cell — multiple contributors can publish numbers for the same
compose without rewriting the file. Rig format is
"@handle (rig-shape)" e.g. "@whamp (4× 3090 PCIe x4/x16/x8/x16, 300 W)".

Why now: same compose can produce different numbers on different rigs
(power caps, PCIe lane counts, NVLink topology) — that's a feature,
not a noise source. The Rig column makes the (compose, rig) tuple
the unit of measurement, which is what's actually portable.

Adds a "How to add a row for your rig" section pointing to the
Numbers from your rig issue template.

- BENCHMARKS.md (new) — fills the gap that PR template + CONTRIBUTING.md
  reference. Consolidates measured numbers from MULTI_CARD/SINGLE_CARD/
  STRUCTURED_COT into a single by-model table. Includes the canonical
  bench prompt definition, the verify-stress + soak-continuous matrix
  per variant, and the dual4 + dual4-dflash rows promised on the
  PR #44 merge (Whamp's 4× 3090 cross-rig data, including the bench-vs-
  soak inversion noted on dual4-dflash).
- subset-bench.py — Phase 3 mode: --full (all 164 HE+) + --include-lcb
  (50 LCB v6 release_v6/leetcode/2025-01-01 cutoff) + --he-start/--he-end
  + --lcb-start/--lcb-end + --label for parallel dual-GPU sharding.
  The flags compose so a 2-GPU rig can split 0–82/82–164 + 0–25/25–50
  across two endpoints, halving wall time from ~5h to ~2.5h on RTX 3090.

UPSTREAM.md
  Adds 5 vLLM rows + 1 Sandermage row tracking the upstream context for
  Cliff 2b that we mapped today:
  - vllm#36598 (closed via #36599) — original Triton autotuner OOM report
  - vllm#36599 (merged, in our image) — _warmup_triton_kernels at V1
    profile. Closes boot-time autotuner OOM but NOT Cliff 2b. Added clarifier
    that FLA kernels use do_not_specialize=["T"], so production T=4128 isn't
    a missed autotune key — runtime fragmentation is from Triton kernel
    binaries staying resident in CUDA context, not autotuner cache.
  - vllm#36973 (open, RTX 5090-specific) — _warmup_prefill_kernels leak.
    haosdent comment #18-19 traced bulk to TMA overhead (~22 MiB/SM × 170 SMs).
    Doesn't apply to Ampere SM86 (no TMA hardware). Useful context for
    understanding why TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=1 doesn't help on our hardware.
  - vllm#37700 (open, closes #36973 for SM12x) — TMA misclassification fix.
    Desktop Blackwell only. Doesn't apply to us.
  - "Cliff 2b — multi-turn accumulated-context OOM" — new tracking row for
    Sandermage genesis-vllm-patches#19 we filed today. Captures all the
    dead-end levers we tested + the streaming-refactor proposal.

SINGLE_CARD.md
  Adds @stiggy2k16's measured `minimal+0.95+65536` data point as a documented
  small-context vLLM safe path (since vllm/minimal at 32K cap is below
  Cliff 2b territory and 64K still works in his measurements). Gives users
  a third single-card option between "use the long-* variants and OOM at
  multi-turn" and "use llama.cpp at 21 TPS" — when their workload is
  bounded at <60K accumulated context, this is faster than llama.cpp
  while staying cliff-safe.

- **docs: surface Cliff 2b multi-turn envelope + WHY TP=2 / llama.cpp escape** ([04764c5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/04764c5f28c3c21ad0621d9693356a3712918514))


Today's full validation matrix exposed Cliff 2b — DeltaNet GDN forward
fires under accumulated multi-turn context (~21-26K), not just at single
prompts >50-60K. All 6 single-card vLLM variants FAIL v2 continuous;
only vllm/dual (TP=2) and llamacpp/default survive cleanly. Three issues
filed today (#41, #42, #43) all map to the same class. Docs needed to
reflect this so users don't keep landing on long-text/long-vision/
tools-text and burning time tuning what won't fix.

docs/SINGLE_CARD.md
  - New ⚠️ section at top: single-card vLLM unsafe for hermes/openhands/
    OpenCode/Cline/OpenClaw/Aider/Cursor with retained context. Routing
    tree to dual.yml or llamacpp/default.
  - Existing "One limitation" split into Cliff 2a (single-prompt, mostly
    closed v7.69) and Cliff 2b (multi-turn, NOT closed). Reasons each
    can/can't be tuned at config layer.

docs/CLIFFS.md
  - TL;DR table extended from 2 cliffs to 3 (Cliff 2a + 2b separated).
  - New section "Why TP=2 escapes" — per-card head sharding halves the
    GDN live-tensor sizes (48 MiB → 24 MiB on v/u/o etc., 97 → 49 on h).
    Concrete byte math; total per-card live FLA set drops from ~500 MiB
    to ~250 MiB. Validated 0 MiB growth on dual.yml v2 continuous.
  - New section "Why llama.cpp escapes" — three concrete differences:
    (1) different GDN kernel (own CUDA, smaller per-step working buffers
    vs FLA Triton), (2) ggml manual allocator (no PyTorch caching layer
    fragmentation), (3) no JIT/Triton autotune (pre-compiled, static
    layout from boot). Trade ~3× decode speed for cliff-immunity.

docs/FAQ.md
  - New troubleshooting entry: "My hermes / openhands / OpenCode / Cline /
    OpenClaw / Cursor session OOMs after a few turns. What do I do?"
    Lists every dead-end we tested today so users don't repeat them:
    mem-util tuning, MTP-off, max-num-batched-tokens (Mamba block_size

Upstream sweep 2026-05-03:

- genesis-vllm-patches#9 (P68/P69 8000-char threshold): 🟠 Roadmap → ✅
  Closed 2026-05-01. Fix shipped in v7.65+ (50K threshold), we're on v7.69
  so the fix lives in our pin. Composes still keep P68/P69 commented out;
  enabling them is queued for next-week revisit.
- transformers#45283 (Qwen3.5 GGUF support): 🟡 Open → ❌ Closed without fix
  2026-04-28 (no associated PR, looks won't-fix). Means llama.cpp remains
  the only GGUF path for Qwen3-Next family.
- vllm#35975 + vllm#40361: noted upstream stallage (51d / 13d). Genesis dev
  tip f2147ad ships PN35 as a native backport of #35975 — drops the local
  patch_inputs_embeds_optional.py sidecar when we bump pin.

New "Active follow-ups (next-week revisit queue)" section near the top of
the file captures three items deferred for week of 2026-05-10:
  1. Genesis pin bump 2db18df → f2147ad (drops the inputs_embeds sidecar)
  2. Enable P68/P69 across composes (now safe at 50K threshold on v7.69)
  3. Rebase + ping vllm#40361 (our Marlin pad-sub-tile-n PR, 13d stale)

Pause rationale: Sandermage typically lands stable tags from dev tip — wait
for him to surface a v7.70 stable signal before bumping. Dev tip can churn.
Items 2 + 3 ride along in the same revisit window for batch review.

- **docs: surface scripts/update.sh + repo-drift detection** ([bca5a06](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/bca5a063c964b0029189c46aeec6cdce6323b72a))


Companion docs update for 43fe2a4. Three places where users would expect
to find this:

- README.md — adds step 7 to quick-start ("Keep your install up-to-date")
  with the upgrade flow + the soft-warn note. Updates the directory tree
  to list update.sh and refresh the preflight.sh one-line summary.
- docs/FAQ.md — new "How do I keep my install up-to-date?" entry under
  Setup, covering the dirty-tree refusal, --dry-run / --force flags, and
  the cross-link to the existing Genesis-pin warning. Also tweaked the
  "How do I bump Genesis" entry to point at update.sh as the normal path
  and frame manual bumps as the testing-only escape hatch.
- CHANGELOG.md — 2026-05-03 entry describing both pieces (preflight_repo_drift
  + scripts/update.sh) and the JusefPol dual-nvlink variant landing.

- **docs(vllm-marlin-pad/README): add sanity-check procedure before image-bump syncs** ([1bb85fa](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1bb85fadb82f92b80216a6a1dfa4eff87e25b03d))


The "is the patch still needed?" check was missing from the original
sync procedure — it assumed the patch was still relevant and only
verified that upstream files hadn't diverged. Wrong order: first
confirm the bug still applies, THEN check for divergence.

Adds three explicit pre-sync checks:

1. vllm#40361 PR state — `gh pr view 40361 --json state,mergedAt`.
   If merged → delete this directory + 4 compose mount lines (patch
   obsolete). If still open → continue.

2. Pinned image's marlin.py grep — confirm pad-sub-tile-n symbols
   (_maybe_pad_n, GPTQ_MARLIN_MIN_THREAD_N, round_up, _marlin_orig_n)
   are absent in upstream. If absent → patch still doing real work.
   If present → investigate whether the fix landed under a different
   PR, verify the bug doesn't fire on a fresh dual-card boot before
   deleting.

3. Upstream files diverged check — git log between fork base and new
   image SHA. If empty → re-copy patched files. If non-empty → rebase
   patch first.

Plus a "Last-checked log" table so future readers can see the
verification trail without re-running. Bootstrapped with the
2026-05-03 initial-vendor entry showing PR OPEN + grep empty.

Self-correction triggered by user asking "did you check if we still
needed the patch since we moved on to v0.20?" before the original
vendor work — a check I'd done implicitly via "files unchanged" but
hadn't explicitly confirmed via PR state and bug-presence grep.
Procedure codified to make the assumption gap visible.

- **docs: add MULTI_CARD.md for 3+ GPU users (derived, untested locally)** ([75a64a6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/75a64a694e0789d2ec3ed74c64eda96c789a2de8))


Maintainer rig is 2x 3090. Users with 3+ GPUs (4x 3090, 8x A6000,
mixed setups) have been asking "does club-3090 apply?" — yes, but we
can't ship pre-baked configs for hardware we can't validate.

New `docs/MULTI_CARD.md` explains:

- **What scales** going TP=2 → TP=4 → TP=8: per-card weights drop
  proportionally, KV pool grows linearly, Cliff 2 disappears entirely
  on TP=4+ (DeltaNet GDN forward state splits across cards).
- **What doesn't scale**: per-stream decode TPS without NVLink. PCIe
  NCCL all-reduce overhead grows with TP count — TP=4 PCIe per-stream
  may be lower than TP=2. Aggregate concurrent throughput still scales.
- **Valid TP values for Qwen3.6-27B**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10. Must divide
  both 80 attention heads AND 5 KV heads cleanly. TP=3, 6, 7, 9 do NOT
  work — vLLM errors at boot. Awkward GPU counts (3, 6, 7) need to use
  the next-lower valid TP with idle cards.
- **Derivation recipe**: copy `dual.yml`, change three lines
  (--tensor-parallel-size, --max-num-seqs, --max-num-batched-tokens),
  pick a distinct container_name + port. Marlin pad-sub-tile-n patch
  stays mounted (more relevant at higher TP, not less).
- **What to expect on TP=4** (4x 3090 PCIe): per-card peak ~16-18 GB
  (vs 23.6 GB on TP=2), Cliff 2 doesn't apply, per-stream TPS likely
  drops to ~50-65 narr / ~70-80 code from PCIe NCCL overhead, but KV
  pool 2x larger means more concurrent streams fit.
- **What to expect on TP=8** (server-class): per-card pressure
  essentially disappears. With NVLink fabric, per-stream TPS could
  approach 1.6-1.8x single-card vs the ~1.0x we see on PCIe TP=2.
- **Cross-rig data ask**: TP=4 PCIe, TP=4 with NVLink, TP=8 server-
  class, TP=4 mixed cards. Each is a coverage gap we'd love filled.

Honest disclaimer at the top: nothing in this doc is locally measured,
all derived from documented vLLM TP behavior + our TP=2 baseline +
Marlin pad math. Asks community contributors with 3+ card hardware to
share `bash scripts/report.sh --bench > my-rig.md` results.

Why no pre-baked composes:
1. Can't hardware-test them.
2. Hardware combinations explode (different VRAM, NVLink topology,
   power profiles, allreduce characteristics — no single quad.yml
   optimal for all).
3. Users at this scale are typically experienced — they need
   methodology + constraints + dial, not hand-held tested compose.

If a community member contributes a tested compose for their topology
(verify-stress passing + bench numbers), we ship it under
models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/ with credit.

Cross-links: README.md "Pick your path" table now includes 3+ GPU row;
DUAL_CARD.md gets a header pointer to MULTI_CARD.md.

- **docs(FAQ): add WSL2 RAM-constraint failure mode to troubleshooting** ([3bf7da7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3bf7da7501e3bc0e909cf7eeb55acb425697e7e3))


[@RossNE99]'s case in #32 surfaced a failure mode that wasn't in the
FAQ: vLLM throws a misleading "GPU OOM, tried to allocate 44 MiB"
error at model load when the actual problem is WSL2's default RAM
allocation (50% of Windows host) being insufficient for the 17.69 GiB
checkpoint.

The smoking-gun log line is `[weight_utils.py:934] Auto-prefetch is
disabled because ... checkpoint size (17.69 GiB) exceeds 90% of
available RAM` — surfaced automatically by report.sh now, but not
otherwise visible in standard triage output.

Adds a troubleshooting entry pointing at the .wslconfig fix
(memory=24GB minimum, swap=8GB), with the diagnostic log line so users
can self-identify if they suspect this. Also cross-links the original
RossNE99 repro thread for context.

Was invisible until report.sh captured the boot log highlights — good
worked example of why the standardized rig dump is more useful than
ad-hoc nvidia-smi pastes.

- **docs: surface triage ladder at issue-filing time + add at-a-glance table** ([f55b0a7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f55b0a734f259f031da18e7d823ef7eb44dbbca5))


Two related improvements after [@noonghunna]'s observation that the
ladder we just added (commit 9560efd) was structurally OK but easy to
miss:

1. **FAQ ladder gets an at-a-glance table** at the top of
   "Before symptom-matching" section. Five rows, one per step, showing
   variant name + what each step adds + what it tests. Plus a one-line
   path-finder ("if single-card, run 1-3; if dual, layer-by-layer
   tells you which intersection breaks"). Readers no longer have to
   scroll through 80 lines before they see the full ladder shape.

2. **Bug report template leads with the ladder** instead of jumping
   straight to the report.sh ask. New intro:

      "Before filing — try the 5-step triage ladder first"

   Links into the FAQ section anchor. Acknowledges that "a lot of
   'should I file a bug' questions resolve at step 1 or 2 (often
   re-running setup.sh is the fix)." Worth 15 min before opening an
   issue. The report.sh paste field stays — for users who've done the
   ladder and have a real bug to file.

3. **Issue chooser config gets a third option** above
   "General Q&A / discussion":

      "Troubleshooting — try the 5-step triage ladder first"

   Clicking "Open an issue" → users now see Troubleshooting / Q&A /
   Bug-report / Bench-contribution as four distinct paths, with the
   ladder explicitly named as a self-help option BEFORE the bug-report
   template appears.

Result: users with budget / boot / MTP-class issues get pointed at
the ladder twice (once in the chooser, once in the bug template intro)
before they ever fill out the form. Reduces the "filed a bug that
turned out to be a partial-pull / setup-not-rerun / config-too-tight
issue" pattern that's eaten the last few triage rounds.

- **docs(FAQ): add 5-step triage ladder before symptom-matching** ([9560efd](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9560efd1f7616bd91b3d753d5ffc961ad3d3641d))


When users hit boot OOMs, MTP weirdness, or TQ3/long-context budget
issues, our previous troubleshooting flow jumped straight to
symptom-matching. That misses the systematic narrowing pass: validate
the simplest stack works first, then add one variable per step until
the failing layer is isolated.

New leading section in Troubleshooting:

- Step 1 — `vllm/minimal` (32K + fp8, no Genesis, no spec-decode):
  validates hardware, driver, Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, model
  files, base vLLM. Strips out every layer that could be the cause.

- Step 2 — `vllm/tools-text` (75K + fp8 + MTP + Genesis): adds Genesis
  + MTP K=3. Still fp8 KV (no TQ3 yet). Most common failure here is
  GENESIS_PIN-vs-tree mismatch — re-run setup.sh.

- Step 3 — `vllm/long-text` (180K + TQ3 + MTP + full Genesis): adds
  TurboQuant 3-bit KV + long-context. The production-target single-card
  config. Failure here narrows to TQ3 setup, GDN >60K hardware wall,
  or Cliff 1 mech B (closed since v7.69 PN25).

- Step 4 — `vllm/dual` (262K + fp8 + TP=2 + 2 streams, Genesis-less):
  adds TP=2 NCCL + multi-GPU memory split. Crucially removes Genesis,
  since dual.yml is intentionally Genesis-less. Failure here despite
  step 3 working narrows to TP=2 NCCL specifically. WSL2 is the most
  common trigger (its vGPU layer adds memory accounting wrinkles that
  bare-metal Linux doesn't have).

- Step 5 — `vllm/dual-turbo` (262K + TQ3 + TP=2 + Genesis): the full
  multi-card stack. Failure here despite step 4 narrows to the
  TQ3-on-TP=2-with-Genesis intersection.

The ladder works for both single and dual-card users because steps 1-3
isolate stack layers regardless of GPU count, and steps 4-5 add TP=2
surface separately. A dual-card user hitting issues should still run
steps 1-3 on a single card first — it's the only way to tell apart
"single-card stack issue that also breaks dual" vs "TP=2 NCCL specific."

Existing symptom-pattern-matching list demoted to "Quick recognition
guide" sub-section, kept verbatim — still useful for users who already
know the failure surface and want to skip the ladder.

Going forward we'll point to this ladder explicitly in triage replies
on issues / discussions, replacing the ad-hoc "have you tried X?" pattern.

- **docs: add PFlash integration feasibility memo (Codex audit, 2026-05-02)** ([90a83a3](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/90a83a3fb5e4a931380a3920b30047ab062a23a2))


Per-task investigation by Codex/ChatGPT after we asked: can PFlash
(Luce-Org's long-context prefill accelerator from lucebox-hub) be
integrated into our vLLM stack — natively, as Genesis patches, or by
adopting lucebox-hub as a third engine?

Memo verdict, source-grounded against locally-inspected
/tmp/lucebox-hub repo + vLLM at our pinned commit 7a1eb8ac2ec...:

- **Architectural decoding:** PFlash compresses a long prompt by running
  a Qwen3-0.6B drafter, scoring chunks via tail attention, keeping top
  ~5%, then re-tokenizing for the target. The target sees a continuous
  shorter prompt (no preserved positions, no sparse gaps in KV).
- **Path A (native vLLM port):** possible but huge — 2-4 months for a
  narrow Qwen-only prototype, 6+ months for upstream-quality. Dominated
  by request lifecycle / scheduler / memory / tokenizer work, NOT
  kernels (BSA is FA2-derived and SM80+/Ampere-friendly).
- **Path B (Genesis monkey-patch):** doesn't fit. Engine-level
  coordination dominates; Genesis can't robustly own a second-model
  lifecycle, scheduler integration, or CUDA graph profiling for the
  drafter.
- **Path C (adopt lucebox-hub as third engine):** most attractive
  practical path. PR #78 (dual-GPU phase-split, merged 2026-05-02)
  improves the harness materially. But target generation, OpenAI
  behavior, sampling/chat-template gaps, and routing remain outside
  PR #78 — not production-ready as a third engine yet.

Recommendation: don't kick off integration now. Watch lucebox-hub
daemon stability + a real club-3090 user surfacing a TTFT-bound
workload that current dual.yml / llama.cpp doesn't address. Quick
external-proxy POC (Path B') possible at ~1-3 weeks effort if we ever
want a measurement-only setup.

Memo updated 2026-05-02 evening with Path C addendum after submodule
init pulled lucebox-hub/dflash/deps/{Block-Sparse-Attention,llama.cpp}
and the dual-GPU phase-split PR was audited.

- **docs: route bug + bench templates through scripts/report.sh** ([b9a1305](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b9a13056cc04a45f828c4d6e3809ce2f5c979c60))


Bug report and numbers-from-your-rig issue templates previously asked for
6+ separate fields each (docker logs, verify-full, nvidia-smi, GPU config,
compose variant, commit, etc.). The new scripts/report.sh captures all
of that in one paste-ready dump, plus the data we kept asking individually
(power caps + default vs current, NVLink topology, OS, system RAM, idle
GPU VRAM detection, container runtime versions, cached vLLM image SHAs).

Templates restructured to lead with `bash scripts/report.sh > my-rig.md`:
- bug-report.yml: 6 required + 2 optional fields → 3 required (what
  happened, repro, rig report) + 1 optional (extras / fallback). Net -38%
  lines, but more importantly: one command instead of six manual asks.
- numbers-from-your-rig.yml: 5 required + 2 optional fields → 1 required
  (rig + bench report via `--bench`) + 1 optional (notes / fallback). Net
  -38% lines.

Both templates retain manual-fallback guidance for users who can't run
report.sh (no shell access, different rig environment, etc.).

CONTRIBUTING.md "Numbers from your rig" + "Bug reports" entries updated
to reference report.sh as the primary path. README.md repo layout adds
report.sh to scripts/ list, plus a one-liner in the docs-and-extras
paragraph pointing affected users at the script.

Net effect: future cross-rig contributors share more standardized data
with less effort. Triage threads stop bouncing on "could you also send
me X?" follow-ups for the surface report.sh covers.

- **docs(dual-card): substrate refs from v7.65/v7.66 → v7.69** ([95b2c3b](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/95b2c3b1fa36600f88815b90d66eda86e20eb22c))


DUAL_CARD.md and dual-turbo.yml were on the v7.65/v7.66 era. Cliff 2
doesn't apply on TP=2 (state splits across cards — 237K verified on
dual.yml), so the v7.69 cutover is a hygiene bump on the dual side,
not a recipe change.

Header comment on dual-turbo.yml updated to note that the
patch_workspace_lock_disable.py mount is now redundant (Genesis PN34
covers the same surface via env-gate). Sidecar drop queued for the
next dual-card validation pass — leaving it mounted for now since
it's harmless and the validation costs a fresh dual-card boot.

Bench rows on DUAL_CARD.md note "v7.69 re-bench pending" against the
existing v7.65 measurements (decode TPS regime unchanged by the
bump; PN32/P103/PN30-part3 fix Cliff 2 prefill envelope, not
steady-state decode).

Sweep all stale v7.66 / fc89395 substrate references to v7.69 (commit
2db18df) + local vllm#35975 inputs_embeds backport. Ship the Balanced
MTP (long-text.yml, 180K + 0.93) and Max-context (long-text-no-mtp.yml,
200K + 0.95, no MTP) variants as the Cliff 2 closure recipes — both
PASS the 60K single-prompt envelope (623s and 537s wall respectively).

Updates:
- CHANGELOGs (root + model) — new v7.69 PM entry above v7.66
- README + SINGLE_CARD + HARDWARE + EXAMPLES + FAQ + INTERNALS + VLLM
  engine doc — Cliff 2 status, substrate pins, mem-util defaults,
  variant table, sidecar list
- vllm/README.md compose menu refreshed for the new ctx envelopes
- model README patch surface table — added PN30 part3, PN32, P103,
  PN34 rows; collapsed P98 reference to PN34 env-gate
- tools/charts/gen-perf.py + gen-vram.py — substrate label bumped to
  v7.69 + #35975, panel labels for the long-text variants updated,
  long-text-no-mtp 200K Max-context noted as bench-pending in chart
- All performance + VRAM charts (svg + png) regenerated

Cliff 2 60K closure: Genesis v7.69 (PN32 GDN chunked-prefill + P103
worker self-install + PN30 part3 + PN34 workspace_lock relax) plus
local backport of vllm#35975 (~444 MiB freed on text-only paths).
3 sidecars dropped on long-text variants; 2 sidecars retained on
master (patch_inputs_embeds_optional.py, patch_tolist_cudagraph.py).

>60K single-prompt still hits the 24 GB hardware-physical wall on
single-card. For those: dual-card TP=2 (verified at 237K) or
llama.cpp single-card (262K, different engine).

- **docs(UPSTREAM): track Pflash (Luce-Org prefill accelerator) — flagged by @troymroberts (#25)** ([e0e1752](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e0e1752b3a0299671a4c5fec610fa3e321caed95))


Pflash is a new prefill-acceleration technique announced 2026-05-01 by
Sandro Puppo / Luce-Org. Sits in front of DFlash: speculative prefill +
block-sparse attention compresses 128K prompts to ~6.5K tokens before
the target's prefill runs. Claims 10.4× TTFT speedup at 128K with NIAH
recall intact. Same lucebox-hub repo we already track for DFlash; same
Ampere sm_80+ target; same Qwen3.6-27B model class.

C++/CUDA only — no vLLM/llama.cpp integration today. Currently NOT a
club-3090 shipping option (lucebox-hub has the daemon-mode stability
issues already documented in this file).

Added as a watch entry with explicit "club-3090 plans to explore
integration" framing per maintainer direction. Re-evaluate when:
  (a) lucebox-hub passes our verify-stress.sh 7-probe ladder, OR
  (b) an upstream-vLLM port emerges.

Cross-rig signal worth flagging to Sandermage: PFlash's drafter
attention scoring + block-sparse attention on a small drafter may share
kernel surface with PN26b sparse-V on SM86.

Tested v7.68 dev tip (18e65e3) on `v7.68-cliff2-test` branch (pushed to
origin). Sander accepted our 3 cross-rig sidecars as Genesis-native;
attempted the drop but found:

- ✅ PN25 v7.68 — works on TP=1 (replaces our PN25 register fix)
- ✅ PN34 — works (env-opt-in; replaces our workspace_lock_disable)
- ❌ PN30 v7.68 — drift-marker false-positive breaks the patch
- ❌ P103 — wrap reports "rebound at 0 caller sites", never intercepts
- ❌ PN32 alone — insufficient on TP=1 + 24GB

Master keeps v7.66 (fc89395) + 3 local sidecars. Re-evaluate when Sander
cuts v7.69.

- **docs: Genesis #14/#15 fixes shipped on Sandermage dev (P38B/P15B/PN25 pending v7.65)** ([60d7b02](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/60d7b02c55ae3c4b85d65977508068ab2e25ed27))


Sandermage shipped both companion fixes within hours of our reports:
- P38B (#14 fix) — text-patch source-level hook in _continuation_prefill.
  Source edit survives aot_compile_fullgraph capture; different from our
  PN12→PN25 torch.library.custom_op route, both reach the same end.
- P15B (#15 fix) — direct backport of our suggestion path 1. Clamps
  max_seqlen_k at TQ wrapper boundary from cu_seqlens_k. One GPU→CPU
  sync/call, acceptable on the infrequent continuation-prefill path.

Both opt-in via env (GENESIS_ENABLE_P38B_COMPILE_SAFE=1 / P15B_FA_VARLEN_
CLAMP=1) on Sandermage's dev branch. Will land in v7.65 release.

UPSTREAM.md rows for #14 + #15 + PN25 updated to status "Fix on dev,
pending v7.65" with the env vars to enable when adopting. Added P98
marker false-positive row (we side-noted it on Genesis #9 thread —
awaiting Sander's call on a marker fix).

CLIFFS.md "Update 2026-05-01 PM" section extended with the P38B/P15B
landing news + a cross-reference to the v0.20 path: empirically the 50K
cliff doesn't reproduce on v0.20 either, so we have two independent
paths to the same outcome. Holding both until v7.65 ships so the master
migration is one coherent PR (pin + Genesis + sidecar cleanup + context

- **docs+composes: refresh long-text/long-vision/bounded-thinking headers + max_tokens guidance** ([cc4f083](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/cc4f0835e6b0214b5775ffd3bb638a0b6e8cf0d7))


The compose headers were stale (long-text said 218K + 0.985, long-vision
192K + 0.98, bounded-thinking 218K) and didn't reference v7.64 or the
new patch stack. Updated all three to reflect the shipped 185K + 0.975
(text) / 140K + 0.95 (vision) configs and link to docs/CLIFFS.md "Update
2026-05-01 PM" for the bisection rationale.

Each compose header now also documents the recommended client max_tokens
default:
  - long-text + long-vision (FREE thinking): 8192 (16384 for hard
    reasoning / competition problems). 4096 was the trap that bit our
    LCB v6 baseline mid-think.
  - bounded-thinking (FSM grammar caps think): 4096 is sufficient — the
    grammar bounds think to ~150-300 structured tokens.

docs/EXAMPLES.md gets a new top-of-doc "max_tokens defaults" table so
copy-paste users land on the right number without reading the bench
forensics. Two existing examples bumped: math reasoning 400 → 2048 (easy
math but FREE thinking can run that), Quicksort code 800 → 4096 (code
gen with FREE thinking traps at 800).

Smoke-test "Capital of France" examples kept at max_tokens=200 — that's
the documented intentional headroom for thinking + short answer.

Following 1a931b4 (long-text 130K + 0.95, long-vision 120K + 0.94), this
brings the rest of the user-visible surface in line:

bounded-thinking.yml gets the same backoff (was 218K + 0.985 → 130K + 0.95)
plus full patch parity with long-text (P37, PN17, compile-safe sidecar
mount + apply step, P104 already present).

User-facing docs updated:
- engines/VLLM.md TL;DR + KV cache table commentary.
- engines/LLAMA_CPP.md "when to use vLLM instead" (was citing 218K
  text-only; now 130K).
- STRUCTURED_COT.md "When to pick this over the standard long-text"
  (was 218K; now 130K).
- SINGLE_CARD.md picker table, the prominent ⚠️ box, the activation-
  budget rationale, and the long-vision / long-text per-variant blurbs.
- models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md long-text/long-vision/bounded-thinking

Historical references (CLIFFS.md "Update 2026-04-30 PM" section, etc.)

- **docs(compose): document Cliff 1 mech B real-workload gap + escape hatches (#16)** ([6bff99a](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/6bff99a3f2a2bc17caaf72c7e23b465799094d27))


VolandBerlioz on Reddit reported reproducible Cliff 1 OOM at the FFN
intermediate buffer (138 MiB) on real OpenCode workloads (~30K-token
sys-prompt + tool-schema prefill) on long-text.yml and long-vision.yml,
even with PN12 anchor sidecar + P104 FA clamp sidecar both applying.

Root cause analysis (issue #16): PN12 patches eager-mode
SiluAndMul.forward_cuda, but vLLM dev205+ runs cudagraph_mode=
FULL_AND_PIECEWISE which inductor-compiles the FFN forward and inlines
the SiluAndMul op. The compiled forward never calls our patched method,
so the pool is bypassed. Our 25K synthetic verify-stress happens to hit
shapes that go through eager (or pre-PN12 cudagraph capture); real
coding-agent prefill shapes hit the inductor-compiled path with
s18=4128 and OOM at empty_strided_cuda((s18, 17408), ...).

Documenting the gap and three escape hatches in long-text.yml,
long-vision.yml, and bounded-thinking.yml header comments:
1. Switch to tools-text.yml (75K, fp8 KV, PN8 reaches compile path)
2. Add --enforce-eager (~20-30% TPS hit; PN12 reliably applies)
3. Lower --gpu-memory-utilization to 0.94 (~250 MiB more activation)

Real fix tracked in issue #16 — needs an inductor-aware sidecar or
compile-pass-level intervention. Outside the scope of this commit.

- **charts: add tweet-asset variant (single-card vLLM only, 2 bars)** ([f754669](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f754669562ea2be8f83215423a112b2f4b0af433))


New output: docs/img/performance-single-vllm.{png,svg} — just the two
recommended single-3090 vLLM routes (long-vision 198K + long-text 218K).
Designed for the launch tweet so the image scope matches the tweet text
exactly (no dual, no llama.cpp, no Luce).

Also made the substrate footer line conditional on which engines actually
appear in the chart — vLLM-only charts no longer show llama.cpp/Luce
substrate cruft.

Two issues caught in review of the previously-merged chart fix:

1. Combined performance.png had group labels "1× 3090 — llama.cpp" and
   "1× 3090 — Luce DFlash *experimental*" overlapping horizontally at
   figsize=(15, 7.0) with 11 bars. Bumped to (18, 7.5) and split labels
   into 2 lines (cards / engine) so each group label fits over its band
   without colliding.

2. VRAM dual chart title didn't make it explicit that all 4 dual configs
   run vLLM (someone might assume "dual-dflash" uses Luce DFlash, the
   single-card project). Now reads "Dual 3090 — vLLM (TP=2), per-card
   breakdown — all 4 configs run vLLM; dual-dflash uses vLLM's DFlash
   spec-decode."

The 7-bar single-card chart was cramped at figsize=(11, 6.0) — the
"single 3090 — Luce DFlash *experimental*" group label collided with
the value labels above the long-text 218K bars.

Bumped:
- single chart figsize 11→13 wide, 6.0→6.5 tall
- combined chart figsize 14→15 wide, 6.5→7.0 tall
- title pad 22→36 (more room above for group-label band)
- y_band lifted from 1.10× to 1.18× max bar height
- ylim raised from 1.20× to 1.30× max bar height
- group label fontsize 10→9.5 to fit longer labels

Group labels now sit cleanly above value labels with adequate
separation. Twitter-ready.

3.6 draft, 2026-04-30 PM. Significant progress since 2026-04-22 but
several gaps still keep it off the recommended list.

Measured (RTX 3090, greedy, single-stream, n_gen=1000):

Files:
- docs/SINGLE_CARD.md: new "Watch list — Luce DFlash" section after the

  mode, stress-passing TQ3 + 65K config) and what still keeps it off the
  recommended list (greedy only, under-trained 3.6 draft, no vision,
  thinking-mode quirk, build fragility, daemon-mode empty-prompt bug).

- docs/UPSTREAM.md: new Luce DFlash watch table with 6 specific items —
  z-lab draft training, build fragility (submodule ref drift on main
  HEAD), daemon-mode regression, enable_thinking handling, greedy-only,
  and prefill OOM in fattn-chunked.cu (closed by TQ3 KV at 65K).

- tools/charts/gen-perf.py: added Luce DFlash 3.6+3.6 row with new
  "single-luce-watch" group (purple, *experimental* label). Footer
  caveat under chart explains why it's experimental. Title bumped to

- **docs: demote 48K/tools-text/minimal to fallback; lead with long-* + llama.cpp** ([48f93e5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/48f93e550fc3232783b516e6d22bf484defb6f5b))


User feedback: the small-ctx variants (48K default, tools-text 75K, minimal
32K) "offer very little context and not many people will find that as
viable options." Now that Cliff 1 is closed on the long-* variants via the
PN12 anchor sidecar, they're strictly more useful than the 48K/75K
alternatives for the workloads most users come for. The single residual
limitation is Cliff 2 on single-prompt >50K, addressed by llama.cpp.

SINGLE_CARD.md:
- TL;DR table reduced to 3 recommended options (long-vision · long-text ·
  llamacpp/default).
- Cliff 2 caveat promoted to a prominent ⚠️ callout right under the table —
  the one limitation users need to know.
- Old per-variant sections folded; small-ctx variants moved to an
  "Other variants in the repo" section as fallback / diagnostic.

scripts/launch.sh:
- Wizard leads with the 3 primary options (long-vision · long-text ·
  llamacpp/default). Diagnostic / niche options bundled at the end with a
  "[fallback]" prefix so they don't dominate the menu.

models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md:
- Single-card recommended-options bullet list now leads with the 3 primary
  variants and explicitly names Cliff 2 as the single shipped limitation.

docs/EXAMPLES.md:
- Cline section: stop pointing at tools-text; long-* now handle Cline's
  tool returns. Cliff 2 is the only remaining caveat to flag.

The original framing of #11 asked whether a Genesis-style FA2 softmax_lse
clamp could close Cliff 1. Post-PN12 anchor finding, the answer is: PN12
anchor-fix (PR #13) closes mech B which was the binding constraint;
FA2 clamp becomes optional defensive coverage of mech A.

Initial 'PN12 is partial / architectural wall' framing was wrong. PN12
was silently no-op'd on dev205+ — same anchor-drift bug class as P101.
Once a local sidecar repairs the anchor, Cliff 1 closes at 205K with
verify-full + verify-stress passing and MTP n=3 active.

Sandermage's PN12 design intent was correct; we don't need a
gate_up_proj pool extension. The anchor fix is the missing piece.

Add "architectural wall" section documenting empirical conclusion from
the Codex agent's 5-hour build session: P101 + P103 + P104 + 50-block-
override on long-text fail at the same FFN buffer (138 MiB / 130.5 MiB
free) regardless of max_model_len in [175K, 205K]. max_num_batched_tokens
is pinned at 4128 by Mamba block_size, sizing the FFN intermediate
buffer at 138 MiB constant. This is the architectural wall for
TQ3 + single-card + MTP at 24GB.

Document what an actual complete fix would require (chunked FFN forward,
drop MTP, FA3/FlashInfer/FlashQLA Ampere path, dual-card TP=2, llama.cpp).

Document explicitly what P104 + P101 anchor fix DO unblock (Genesis
community + future variant optionality, not our currently shipped configs).

Revise recommended path forward: ship P104 + P101 anchor fix as Genesis

- **CLIFFS.md: refine clamp formula + implementation shape (ChatGPT review)** ([da6393b](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/da6393bb79da167a018834dff71843cff2337853))


Three corrections + clarifications from ChatGPT consultation on the
proposed Cliff 1 clamp:

1. Clamp formula correction: use min(attn_metadata.max_seq_len,
   actual_max_seq_len_for_this_batch) — NOT chunk size. Chunk size
   is the Q dimension; softmax_lse pads on the K dimension which
   spans accumulated prompt. Clamping to chunk size would break
   continuation prefill.

2. Specific guards documented: FA2/Ampere only, runtime-not-capture,
   never below max(seqused_k). Each guard maps to a concrete failure
   mode if violated.

3. Implementation shape: env-gated (GENESIS_FA2_CLAMP_MAX_SEQLEN=1),
   diagnostic logging at the call site (num_actual_tokens,
   max_query_len, attn_metadata.max_seq_len, seq_lens.max()), and
   test progression starting at 86K (known-fail) before pushing
   higher.

4. Added "Don't pursue --max-num-batched-tokens=2048 as primary fix"
   to dead-ends — touches Q dimension; cap leak is on K.

5. Tightened recommended path forward — keep default capped at 48K
   UNTIL clamp verified, then cautiously re-open 75K/86K/128K.

- **LLAMA_CPP.md: add structural explanation of why prefill cliffs don't fire** ([17aff4c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/17aff4ce05d14ed56515928d31caf7ccfce72c07))


User asked the obvious question: vLLM at 192K hits Cliff 1 on 25K
tool prefills, but llama.cpp at 262K processes the same message
cleanly — why?

Three structural reasons documented:
1. ggml-cuda attention has no max_seqlen parameter; FA2 does
2. Static KV slab + dynamic workspace vs paged + varlen pre-alloc
3. Cudagraph capture is decode-only; no path for cap-leak

Plus Cliff 2 doesn't fire because llama.cpp's Qwen3-Next GDN
implementation uses online state updates instead of materializing
the chunk_gated_delta_rule O(seq_len * chunk_size) intermediate.

Reframes the 3-4× TPS gap as the necessary trade for batched
worst-case-workspace optimization vs dynamic-shape per-call serving.
This is the architectural defense of the two-routes launch frame.

- docs/UPSTREAM.md — single source of truth, categorized by upstream
  (vLLM / Genesis / fla-org / FlashQLA / llama.cpp / transformers /
  SGLang), with status emoji + what unblocks for us + workaround.
- AGENTS.md (repo root) — AI-coding-agent guidance. The rule:
  before filing or referencing an upstream issue, check + update
  docs/UPSTREAM.md. Also captures today's Genesis-opt-in vetting

Four comparisons:

vs Ollama — same llama.cpp engine but with a wrapper. We own different
ground: pinned-everything reproducibility, full engine flag access
(--cache-type-k q4_0, --mmproj, --spec-type ngram-mod, --parallel),
vLLM as a second engine. Ollama wins on first-contact UX; we win on
"reproducible config another rig can match exactly."

vs LM Studio — desktop GUI vs CLI/Docker. Different audience.

vs raw llama.cpp build — same engine, no Docker. We're the thin
wrapper users can drop any time. Pick raw if you're a llama.cpp
committer or your platform doesn't have an official image.

vs cloud APIs (Together / Fireworks / Anthropic) — the real comparison.
Includes:
  - Pricing landscape table (verify-before-quoting disclaimer)
  - Self-host break-even math: ~$120/month operating, breakeven at
    ~93 TPS sustained generation (5-yr amortization)
  - When self-host wins outside cost: latency floor (120ms TTFT),
    no rate limits, data residency, customization, predictable
    cost, offline, learning value
  - When cloud wins outside cost: bursty low-volume, multi-region,
    frontier-quality (Sonnet/Opus class), maintenance offload
  - The class where club-3090 is genuinely better than both: heavy
    agentic IDE flows, privacy-sensitive analytics, long-context
    where cloud tier-pricing punishes 256K

Closes with a "if you want X pick Y" decision table.

TL;DR + model-row updated to surface the actual user choice instead of
a generic "51-89 TPS depending on config" line. Stress-test findings
from 2026-04-28 confirmed llama.cpp single-card is the only path that
handles 25K+ tool prefills + 90K needle ladder cleanly on this stack;
vLLM dual is the path for max TPS. The middle (vLLM single-card long-
ctx) hits Cliff 1 under realistic agent workloads.

### 🔧 Pin bumps + upstream

- **bump Genesis pin 753344b → fc89395 (v7.66 dev tip)** ([7a7efbe](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7a7efbea0dfd6694abe0bcfcbdb570d85fb9a884))


v7.66 ships 3 new patches relevant to our config:
- PN33 (default ON): spec-decode warmup K-aware sizing, vllm#37521 backport
  EXTENDED beyond EAGLE to cover MTP/ngram. Sander claimed it closes both
  ampersandru's mid-stream OOM AND our workspace_lock AssertionError.
- PN25 v7.66: refactored from `@torch.library.custom_op` to
  `direct_register_custom_op` + `Library("genesis", "FRAGMENT")` at module
  level. Schema introspection at import time eliminates the
  `infer_schema skipped frame` Dynamo crash class.
- PN32 (default OFF): GDN chunked-prefill for Cliff 2 single-24GB-GPU OOM.

Cross-rig validation findings on 1×3090 TP=1
--------------------------------------------

**PN33 partial — narrows but does not close workspace_lock on TP=1.**

Sander's claim was that PN33 closes both ampersandru's mid-stream OOM
AND our workspace_lock AssertionError. Tested both:

| Test                                       | PN33 result      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Engine boot (profile_run workspace lock)   | ✅ closed       |
| Runtime decode (`turboquant_attn.py:1350`) | ❌ still fires  |

Engine boots cleanly without `patch_workspace_lock_disable.py` sidecar
when PN33 is on, BUT the first decode request crashes with the same
`AssertionError: Workspace is locked but allocation from
turboquant_attn.py:1350:_decode_attention requires 0.76 MB`.

Net: keep `patch_workspace_lock_disable.py` sidecar mounted. PN33
narrows the bug surface but doesn't close it for our config.

**PN25 v7.66 still doesn't work on TP=1.**

Sander's `direct_register_custom_op` + `Library("genesis", "FRAGMENT")`
approach replaces v7.65's `@torch.library.custom_op`, eliminating the
`infer_schema` skipped-frame issue. But on TP=1 the new failure mode is
`Library("genesis", "FRAGMENT")` itself failing inside dynamo trace at
`instantiate_user_defined_class_object` (different mechanism, same root
cause: Library construction inside trace context disallowed on TP=1).

Net: keep `patch_pn25_genesis_register_fix.py` v3 (import-time approach).
Our patch text-patches activation.py to register the op at module-import
time as a cached global, BEFORE any trace context exists. Survives both
the v7.65 `@custom_op` and v7.66 `Library` failure modes because we
register outside the trace entirely.

**PN30 dst-shaped temp fix carries forward cleanly.**

Our `patch_pn30_dst_shaped_temp_fix.py` anchor still matches v7.66's
PN30 wiring file. All 4 TQ3 composes still pass probes 4 + 5 (multi-turn
agent, LCB-coding) which would otherwise crash with Sander's upstream
PN30 a9977d8 (compact `.contiguous()` row-stride corruption — see
genesis-vllm-patches#17 reply for the diagnosis).

**PN31 still doesn't fit on 24 GB.** Same memory pressure as v7.65 round.

Validation matrix on v7.66
--------------------------

| Compose            | Probes (verify-stress.sh)                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| long-text          | 6/7 ✅ (Cliff 2 only fail)               |
| long-vision        | 6/7 ✅ (Cliff 2 only fail)               |
| bounded-thinking   | 6/7 ✅ (Cliff 2 only fail)               |
| dual-turbo (TP=2)  | 6/7 ✅ (Cliff 2 only fail)               |

Same coverage as v7.65 + our patches. No new regressions on v7.66.

Net effect of pin bump
----------------------

- Get Sander's v7.66 + PN33 (validated improvement, even if partial)
- Get PN32 available for opt-in (Cliff 2 mitigation, untested by us)
- Same 3 local sidecars retained (PN25 v3, PN30 fix, workspace_lock)
- No simplification possible yet

Per-config + cross-rig summary in
results/v0.20-migration/v766-pin-results.summary.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **v0.20 migration + Genesis v7.65 dev tip + cold-start cache + env-var alignment** ([5aa97a2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/5aa97a25d910012c1a614978665e57fee53934d0))


This branch migrates the entire vLLM stack from `dev205+g07351e088` + Genesis
v7.64 to `0.20.1rc1.dev16+g7a1eb8ac2` + Genesis v7.65 dev tip (commit
`d89a089`). v7.65 is on Sandermage's `dev` branch — explicitly the cross-rig
testing surface he requested in discussion #19; he'll merge dev→main once we
both confirm stable. Pin gates restated when that lands.

What changes
------------

Pin migration:
- vLLM image: nightly-07351e08... → nightly-7a1eb8ac2... (dev205 → v0.20.1rc1.dev16)
- Genesis: 64dd18b (v7.64) → d89a089 (v7.65 dev tip)

Sidecar churn:
- DROPPED: patch_pn12_ffn_pool_anchor.py (PN12 native on v0.20)
- DROPPED: patch_pn12_compile_safe_custom_op.py (Genesis P38B in-source hook)
- DROPPED: patch_fa_max_seqlen_clamp.py (Genesis PN17 + P15B)
- ADDED: patch_workspace_lock_disable.py (relaxes vllm#39226 strict assertion;
  P98 covers same surface but auto-skips on v0.20 due to drift-marker false
  positive — pending Sandermage marker fix)

Env-var alignment to Sandermage's PROD set (start_27b_int4_TQ_k8v4.sh@dev):
- FIXED naming bugs that silently no-op'd patches:
  - PN9_INDEPENDENT_DRAFTER_ATT → _ATTN (was silently OFF)
  - PN22 → PN22_LOCAL_ARGMAX_TP (was silently OFF)
  - PN26_BLOCK_KV → PN26_SPARSE_V_BLOCK_KV (fell back to default 4, not 8)
  - PN26_NUM_WARPS → PN26_SPARSE_V_NUM_WARPS
  - PN26_THRESHOLD → PN26_SPARSE_V_THRESHOLD (fell back to default 0.001, not 0.01)
- ADDED explicit-OFFs to match Sander's PROD verbatim:
  - P78_TOLIST_CAPTURE_GUARD=0 (we use our own patch_tolist_cudagraph.py)
  - P81_FP8_BLOCK_SCALED_M_LE_8=0 (FP8-specific, no-op on TQ3)
  - P82=0, P82_THRESHOLD_SINGLE=0.3
- Cap divergence (justified): PROFILE_RUN_CAP_M=4128 + PREALLOC_TOKEN_BUDGET=4128
  (Sander uses 4096 — vLLM `interface.py:639` forces our config's Mamba
  block_size to 4128 due to TQ3 + TP=1 page-size math; lower values
  AssertionError at boot)
- Carry-forward (intentional): P4 (hybrid TQ required), P65 (TQ spec-CG
  downgrade — pending v0.20 verification that #40880 closure makes it
  redundant)

Cold-start cache mounts (closes #22):
- All 10 composes now mount torch_compile_cache + Triton cache from
  `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/cache/`. First boot warms (~6 min); warm boot
  drops to ~3.2 min (47% faster). Per-stage savings on long-text:
  - Dynamo bytecode transform: 18s → 5s (-73%)
  - torch.compile: 57s → 9s (-85%)
  - Initial profiling/warmup: 51s → 7s (-87%)

Mamba block_size cap fix:
- v0.20 enforces `long_prefill_token_threshold >= block_size`; on hybrid
  Mamba+TQ3, vLLM forces block_size=4128. Bumped GENESIS_PROFILE_RUN_CAP_M
  and PREALLOC_TOKEN_BUDGET 4096→4128 across all 5 main composes.

Default 48K compose:
- Required workspace_lock_disable sidecar after initial v0.20 boot hit
  vllm#39226 strict assertion. Caught during validation, fixed.

Context restored vs dev205 backoffs (validated 33K + 50K stress on v0.20):
- long-text:        185K → 214K (+16%)
- long-vision:      140K → 198K (+41%)
- bounded-thinking: 185K → 214K (+16%)

Bench results (n=5, results/v0.20-migration/):
- long-text 214K        narr 49.74 / code 67.39 (CV 2.6/2.7%)
- long-vision 198K      narr 50.32 / code 66.12 (CV 2.3/4.1%)
- bounded-thinking 214K narr 49.77 / code 65.80 (CV 1.4/2.3%)
- tools-text 75K (fp8)  narr 53.32 / code 69.66 (CV 2.3/1.4%)
- dual-turbo 262K (TP=2) narr 58.33 / code 76.01 per-stream
                         269 TPS aggregate at n=4 streams (3.63x speedup)
- default 48K           narr 48.82 / code 65.98 (n=3)

Validation: verify-full 8/8 on every variant. verify-stress 33K AND 50K
tool-prefill PASS on every variant — the cliff that fired on EVERY dev205
config no longer reproduces.

Docs + charts:
- README + SINGLE_CARD + DUAL_CARD + CLIFFS + EXAMPLES + STRUCTURED_COT
  + FAQ + UPSTREAM + 3 engine docs + model README + INTERNALS + CHANGELOG
  all updated with new pin, ctx, TPS numbers, and "v0.20 unblock" section
- performance.{png,svg} + variants regenerated with measured TPS
- vram-budget.{png,svg} + variants regenerated with measured VRAM
- UPSTREAM tracker: 5 issues moved ✅ closed (PR #12, #13, #14, #15, P104
  superseded by PN17 + P15B)

Issues addressed:
- #16 (Cliff 1 mech B leaks past PN12 on inductor-compiled FFN) — partial:
  v0.20's revised TQ FA paths close the synthetic stress; PN25 (Sander's
  proper compile-path opaque-op fix) is on dev but explicitly opt-in pending
  worker-fork registration fix. Workarounds documented (tools-text fp8 path
  / --enforce-eager) until Sander ships PN25 default-on.
- #20 (launch.sh port + container-name mismatch) — already closed by
  77ca576 (post-issue-filing).
- #22 (cold-start caching) — closed by cache mounts above.

Remaining caveats:
- Cliff 2 (DeltaNet GDN forward, single prompt ≥50-60K) unchanged —
  architectural, applies to all single-card vLLM TQ3 paths. Mitigation:
  dual-turbo TP=2 (state splits across cards) or llama.cpp 262K.
- Default 48K narr_TPS (48.82) slightly under chart's 55 reference —
  bench variance + sample size n=3; not regression.
- Dual.yml / dual-dflash* not re-benched on v0.20; numbers carry forward
  from dev205 (fp8 paths were not TPS-changed by the migration).

- **Genesis v7.62.x + PN8 on FP8 paths (closes Cliff 1 on tools-text)** ([51a4001](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/51a4001af78e7e3cc7d8a0f10fe276c8f10afee6))


scripts/setup.sh — GENESIS_PIN bumped from bf667c7 (v7.54) to 917519b
(v7.62.x release, 2026-04-29). New patches: PN8 (MTP draft online-quant
propagation, backport of vllm#40849), PN11 (Quentin-M streaming tool-call
IndexError fix vllm#41142), per-GPU profile auto-rec, k8v4 unlock on
hybrid GDN via P4+P98.

PN8 enabled on FP8 paths only:
- tools-text.yml: -900 MiB at boot, Cliff 1 25K tool prefill closes,
  -7% code TPS. Net win — production-safe for tool-using agents.
- fast-chat.yml: -800 MiB at boot, no cliff to test at 20K, -4.7% code
  TPS. Free VRAM is useful for tighter mem-util configs.

PN8 not enabled on TQ3 paths (default 48K, long-vision, long-text) or
dual configs:
- default 48K: PN8 is no-op on TQ3 + 0.92 (plenty of headroom already)
- long-vision: PN8 grows KV pool 230 MiB and lifts engine ceiling 192K
  → 198K, but does NOT close Cliff 1 — the 138 MiB allocate is an FFN
  intermediate-buffer activation peak (intermediate_size × max-num-
  batched-tokens), not a draft-model footprint
- long-text: engine ceiling at 206K is gated by attention-block-size
  divisor, not KV; PN8 has nothing to give
- dual.yml: deliberately Genesis-less by design; not worth restructuring

Verify-full passes on default 48K + v7.62.x without PN8 (8/8). Verify-
stress on tools-text + PN8 passes all checks including the 25K tool
prefill that was the launch-tweet headline caveat.

Versioning is CalVer (year.month.day) — this repo is a rolling config
stack, not a versioned API, so date tags are honest about that. Tag
manually via `git tag v2026.05.09 && git push origin v2026.05.09`;
Release Drafter populates the body, you click "Publish" in the UI.

Autolabeler maps existing commit-prefix conventions (docs:, scripts:,
composes:, models:, fix:, chore:) to categories without per-PR label
discipline. Files-based fallback catches direct-to-master doc edits
that touch BENCHMARKS.md / HARDWARE.md / CLIFFS.md.

Closes the loop on @laurimyllari's "include git commit in output"
suggestion (issue #112) by giving cross-rig contributors a stable
version tag to cite.

- **power-cap-sweep: also sum delta.reasoning (third field-path)** ([1528b59](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1528b591c3900fde4c5fffb6af137063053947b5))


Bench parser was reading delta.content + delta.reasoning_content per
the laurimyllari fix in 71e5954. @alexpolo1's vLLM 0.20.1 dual.yml
sweep on issue #104 surfaced a third convention: delta.reasoning
(no _content suffix) — used by some vLLM versions / DeepSeek-style
streaming. Same symptom as #62: all 18 caps reading narr=0.00 / code=0.00
while the sampler captured correct power, SM clock, mem clock, throttle %,
pstate, p-state.

Confirmed by inspecting his attached SSE file (power-cap-N180-narrative.sse,
976 lines): 487 of 488 streamed chunks were in delta.reasoning, zero in
content or reasoning_content.

Fix: add delta.reasoning as a third addend in both decode-single and
decode-concurrent parser sites (lines 422, 550). Validated against the
attached SSE — would have produced 487 chunks / ~48.7 TPS at 180W cap,
consistent with steady-state throttled performance at 735 MHz SM clock.

Backwards-compatible: when the field is empty (most servers), text
contribution is "" so behavior is unchanged.

Refs: #104 (alexpolo1 dual 3090 sweep), #62 (laurimyllari 4090 sweep)

- **power-cap-sweep: sum delta.reasoning_content alongside delta.content** ([71e5954](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/71e5954ea987ece658ecfa1f232ccf3506a41fbf))


Bench script's TPS counter was reading only delta.content from streaming
chat completions. When the server routes thinking tokens to
delta.reasoning_content (--reasoning-format auto, or extra_body
preserve_thinking), the counter saw 0 tokens for the full bench window
even though the GPU was generating fine — produced 0.00 TPS readings
across all caps with otherwise valid sampling data.

Surfaced in @laurimyllari's 4090 sweep (disc club-3090#62) — entire
38-cap decode-single sweep returned 0.00 TPS while sampler captured
correct power, SM clock, mem clock, throttle %, pstate. Same root cause
class as syangsao's opencode hang (#97): client-side parser only knows
about `content`, server routes to `reasoning_content`.

Fix: sum both fields' text length when present. Backwards-compatible —
when REASONING_FORMAT=none (default), reasoning_content is empty so
behavior is unchanged. Validated against running container: smoke test
shows 15 content chunks / 0 reasoning_content chunks at default config,
matching prior behavior. Reasoning-format=auto rigs would now produce
valid TPS readings instead of 0.00.

Applied to both decode-single (~line 416) and decode-concurrent (~538)
bench paths since both use the same SSE parsing pattern.

- **power-cap-sweep: clamp prefill calibration to model context window** ([32f924c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/32f924c1c4889f26113dcf0f3ae8677339a95a08))


Bug surfaced when running prefill-heavy on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at -c 16384:
calibration sized prompt at TPS × target_seconds (~31K tokens at 390W cap)
which exceeded the 16K context. llama.cpp truncated silently → request
returned in ~0.2s → reported TPS = full_prompt_tokens / wall = absurdly
high (~140K TPS, with all sampling fields blank because util>50% sampler
saw nothing).

Fix:
- After calibration probe, query model context via /props (llama.cpp)
  with /v1/models max_model_len fallback (vLLM)
- If detected, clamp calibrated target_tokens to 90% of n_ctx minus 256
  for chat template + max_tokens overhead
- Warn explicitly when clamping fires, with hint to either restart engine
  with bigger -c or lower --target-prefill-seconds
- If detection fails (unknown engine), fall back to existing behavior

Validated end-to-end on A3B at -c 65536: calibration probe at 390W reports
3122 TPS, target=10s would want ~31K tokens, fits within 90% of 65K (= ~58K)
so no clamp triggered. Sweep produced clean monotonic curve from 1543 TPS
@ 190W to 2900 TPS @ 390W with sweet spot 250W → 9.865 TPS/W. Plateau
auto-detection found 340-370W → SM 1680-1710 MHz, 334W draw, 2802 TPS.

- **power-cap-sweep: plateau auto-detection + multi-mode chain docs** ([fd11ae6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/fd11ae64c5dfb29ae0941e29ce96364d85d490cd))


Two related additions:

1. Plateau auto-detection. At end of sweep, scans for 3+ consecutive caps with
   identical draw (±2W) and TPS (±1%) — the firmware boost-clock plateau pattern
   we documented on this 3090 (caps 340-370W decode → SM 1560 MHz lock; caps
   330-370W prefill → SM 1605-1620 MHz lock). When detected:

   - [plateau detected] line emitted to stdout during sweep finalization
   - "Detected boost-clock plateau(s)" section appended to summary file with
     cap range, SM clock (single value or range), draw, TPS, and a directive:
     "raise past Nw to step to the next firmware operating point"

   Smoke-tested on this rig with --caps 340,350,360,370,380 — detected plateau
   at 350-370W, SM 1575-1605 MHz, 333.57W, 34.96 TPS. Caps inside the plateau
   are functionally equivalent — pick the LOWEST to save power for free TPS.

2. Recommended sweep chain docs. HARDWARE.md > Power section now has a
   "Recommended sweep chain" subsection explaining when to run each load mode:

   - decode-single: chat / IDE-agent (~8 min on 3090)
   - prefill-heavy: RAG / long-context (~6 min)
   - decode-concurrent --concurrency auto: multi-tenant (~8 min)

   Sweet spots can differ across modes (we measured 290W decode vs 250W prefill
   on the same 3090) — a single-mode sweep can mislead you about your card's
   full operating envelope. For mixed workloads, take the min cap across the
   modes you care about.

   Same recommendation echoed in the script header comment.

- **power-cap-sweep: add SM/mem clock + throttle% + pstate sampling** ([ab2796d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ab2796dd6eaba09086f03847fa4e8c6cd9d55852))


Cross-rig contributors share charts with these informative columns we
couldn't previously produce. Adds five new fields per cap, computed from
the same in-load sample window (util>50% filter):

- SM clock (median MHz) — distinguishes compute-bound vs bandwidth-bound
  regimes (clock pinned at max while TPS climbs = compute; clock varying
  with cap while TPS plateaus = bandwidth).
- Memory clock (median MHz) — sanity check; should pin at card-spec max.
- Pwr-throttle % — fraction of in-load samples with sw_power_cap=Active.
  100% means power is the binding constraint at that cap.
- Thermal-throttle % — captured via [result] line, not table column.
- P-state — dominant firmware power state. Validates boost-state plateau
  observations on 3090 (caps 340-370W pin at P2 → 334W actual draw).

No flag changes, no acceptance-criteria regressions — smoke-tested on
3-cap decode-single sweep at 23.4s/cap (matches prior baseline).

- **power-cap-sweep: time-bounded prefill-heavy + decode-concurrent (Codex round 2)** ([1ede998](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1ede998ced854f970018380dbf829132b3f9fe5f))


Extends the time-bounded streaming-bench architecture (commit 7877c04, which
was decode-single only) to the other two load modes.

prefill-heavy:
- Adaptive prompt sizing: at sweep start, run a 1000-repeat-filler probe at
  the highest sweep cap, measure TPS, calculate prompt size = TPS × N seconds
  (TARGET_PREFILL_SECONDS=10 default). Use that prompt size across the sweep.
- At low caps the same prompt takes longer (TPS scales down with throttle),
  but never underloads at high caps — solves the "10K-prompt at 390W finishes
  in 9 sec, sampler under-served" issue from earlier today.
- Smoke on 3090 (190-390W, 21 caps): 5m36s total wall, vs 50+ min for old
  token-bounded with default 50K filler.

decode-concurrent:
- Time-bounded streaming with N concurrent curls (same pattern as decode-single,
  just N parallel streams).
- BENCH_RUNS=1 default (was 2) — single batch for sweep shape, multi-batch
  via --bench-runs N for anchor data.
- Warns when --bench-runs > 1 since wall scales linearly.
- Smoke projection on 3090 with concurrency=4: ~8.4 min for 21 caps.

Codex Round 2 — applies their prior decode-single architecture wins to the
remaining load modes, after we caught that they hadn't been optimized when
running apnar's prefill comparison data and seeing 50+ min sweep projections.

Cross-card extrapolation (prefill-heavy + 21-31 cap range):
- 3090: ~6 min ✓ (measured)
- 5090: ~8-10 min (estimated)
- 4090: ~10-12 min (estimated)

3090 prefill-heavy chart added (docs/img/power-cap-3090-prefill.png) showing:
- Sweet spot at 250W (3.617 TPS/W) — different from decode's 290W
- Boost-state plateau 340-370W (326W actual draw) — same firmware behavior
  as decode but different absolute draw level
- TPS rises 543 → 1097 across 190-390W cap range, smooth efficiency decline

HARDWARE.md adds 3 prefill-heavy anchor rows + chart embed with explicit
cross-workload comparison call-out (3090 has different sweet spot for prefill
vs decode on same rig, while 5090 has a much more dramatic difference where
decode is bandwidth-bound at ~91% cap-respect and prefill saturates 100%).

Note: the "boost-state plateau then escape" pattern reproduces across decode
and prefill on the 3090 — it's a firmware behavior of the card, independent
of workload class. Different from 5090 where the workload class itself is
the bottleneck.

- **power-cap-sweep: time-bounded streaming bench (Codex Option A redesign)** ([7877c04](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7877c047b55eb80a2941e6da1490389ffbb5aff3))


Replace token-bounded bench.sh per-cap with inline time-bounded streaming
curl. Per-cap wall is now constant ~23s regardless of cap or card class,
fixing the cross-card portability issue where token-counted benches took
2-4× longer at low caps than high caps.

Implementation:
- New flag --target-cap-seconds (default 10): seconds of streaming per
  direction (narrative + code). Total per-cap = 2 × N + ~3s settle.
- Inline curl with stream=true, max_tokens=99999, --max-time=N. Curl exits
  28 when wall budget hits — that's the bench boundary, not an error.
- TPS = streamed token-chunks / wall_seconds, with fallback to
  usage.completion_tokens if engine emits final usage before timeout.
- Per-cap UTC start/end timestamps + wall-time line in output.
- Updated runtime estimate to use TARGET_CAP_SECONDS math for decode-single.

Validated 2026-05-07 on @noonghunna's 3090 water-cooled rig:
- 21-cap sweep (190-390W): 8m12s total wall (target was ≤12 min)
- Per-cap wall: 23.4s consistent (target was 15-45s)
- Power sampler: 35-37 util>50% samples per cap = 17-18.5s of data
  (target was ≥10s)
- TPS values reproduce prior data within ~1% (290W: 32.16 narr / 0.111
  TPS/W matches our prior 32.08 / 0.111 measurement)

Cross-card extrapolation (linear in cap count, not throttle):
- 5090 (300-600W, 31 caps): ~12 min
- 4090 (230-600W, 38 caps): ~15 min
- 3090 (190-390W, 21 caps): ~8 min ✓

Removed env-var token overrides for decode-single (BENCH_MAX_TOKENS_*
no longer apply since we don't pass token counts). BENCH_WARMUPS and
BENCH_RUNS_PER_CAP also moot for decode-single now. Other load modes
(decode-concurrent, prefill-heavy) unchanged.

Refreshed 3090 chart with clean 21-cap data (no more cold-cache anomaly
on cap 220W since time-bounded approach has no warmup/measurement gap).
HARDWARE.md canonical-command section updated to recommend decode-single
as the default and document the time-bounded methodology.

Implementation by Codex via mcp__codex__codex per brief at
docs/diagnostics/power-cap-sweep-cross-card-codex-brief.md.

- **power-cap-sweep: 4 cross-card portability fixes** ([652103f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/652103f07405535bea9c1dd659ab3610e4f86443))


Surfaced during 3090 water-cooled sweep on @noonghunna's rig — full-envelope
sweep that estimated 15 min took 90+ min because the throttled-cap region
(below 50% of stock TDP) was 3-5× slower per cap than the script's "~30s/cap"
estimate suggests.

Fixes:

1. **Smart default cap floor** (auto-derive only)
   New floor: max(power.min_limit, 50% of stock TDP). Below 50% of stock,
   GPU is so throttled that bench takes 3-5× longer per cap and produces
   uselessly low TPS. Saves substantial time across all card classes:

     3090         (100/370/390): 30 caps → 21 caps (190W-390W)
     3090 Ti      (100/420/450): 36 caps → 25 caps (210W-450W)
     4090         (150/450/600): 46 caps → 38 caps (230W-600W)
     5090         (250/600/600): 36 caps → 31 caps (300W-600W)
     A5000        (100/230/230): 14 caps → 12 caps (120W-230W)
     A6000        (100/300/300): 21 caps → 16 caps (150W-300W)
     RTX PRO 6000 (100/600/600): 51 caps → 31 caps (300W-600W) ← biggest win
     4080         (100/320/350): 26 caps → 20 caps (160W-350W)

   Override via --caps if you explicitly want sub-50%-stock data.

2. **Subprocess cleanup on SIGTERM/SIGINT**
   cleanup() now `pkill -TERM -P $$` to kill orphaned bench.sh / tee / curl
   children. Without this, Ctrl+C left descendants running, writing to log
   files, and holding the GPU power cap. SIGKILL still bypasses (kernel
   guarantee — there's nothing to do about that).

   Also `trap '' INT TERM EXIT` inside cleanup to prevent recursion if
   cleanup itself is interrupted.

3. **Warning on BENCH_WARMUPS=0**
   When user sets BENCH_WARMUPS=0 for fastest sweeps, the FIRST cap will
   have cold-cache bias on narrative TPS (model not warm in any sense,
   narrative bench runs first). Subsequent caps are fine because cache
   stays warm. Print a clear warning so users either expect the bias or
   bump back to BENCH_WARMUPS=1 minimum.

   Validated 2026-05-07 on @noonghunna's 3090 — first cap (220W) gave
   narr=10.28 (cold-cache) vs cap 230W's narr=21.07 (clean) at very
   similar GPU operating points.

4. **Honest runtime estimate range**
   Old: "~${EST_MIN} min (${NUM_CAPS} caps × ~30s/cap)" — only valid at
   normal operating points with default bench shape.
   New: "${EST_MIN}-${EST_MAX} min (range varies with cap throttle + bench
   shape)" where EST_MAX = EST_MIN × 3. Reflects that low-cap regions and
   custom bench shapes can stretch wall time substantially.

All 4 fixes are additive; no behavior change for users running with
default flags + caps in a normal cap range. Cross-card validated by
simulating the cap-derivation against 8 card profiles (table in commit
diff context).

- **power-cap-sweep: env-overridable bench shape for decode-single mode** ([c638c30](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/c638c305873e2a6b109302b2cae1f99fcad5ce43))


Decode-single mode hardcoded WARMUPS=1 RUNS=2 MAX_TOKENS_NARR=500
MAX_TOKENS_CODE=400 = 2700 tokens/cap. At heavily-throttled caps (e.g.
200W on a 3090 → 15 TPS), this takes ~3 min/cap. A 30-cap sweep at
that throttle envelope = 90 min wall, longer than the script's "~30s/cap"
estimate suggests.

Make the four bench shape values env-overridable via BENCH_WARMUPS,
BENCH_RUNS_PER_CAP, BENCH_MAX_TOKENS_NARR, BENCH_MAX_TOKENS_CODE.
Defaults preserve the canonical 1+2 / 500+400 shape — no behavior
change for existing users.

Use case: quick smoke sweeps on slow rigs / wide cap ranges
  BENCH_WARMUPS=0 BENCH_RUNS_PER_CAP=1 \
  BENCH_MAX_TOKENS_NARR=250 BENCH_MAX_TOKENS_CODE=200 \
  sudo -E bash scripts/power-cap-sweep.sh ...
  # ~5x faster — useful when you want curve shape, not anchor-grade data

Note: caller must use 'sudo -E' to preserve env across sudo elevation.

Doc-only change otherwise: source comment block explains the override
contract + recommended quick-bench env values.

- **setup.sh: auto-create .env for WSL2 boot-crash workaround (#60)** ([4861ee7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/4861ee7b6bfb6e337de541e44cecc30e3343b9c4))


WSL2 + driver ≥596.36 + vLLM nightly hit gptq_marlin_repack with
cudaErrorNotReady on boot. PR #84 added PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
override to all 14 composes, but the compose default is still
`expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:512` (correct for
bare-metal). WSL2 users have to know about the override and create
.env manually — they typically don't, hit the crash, and end up
filing issues like #60.

@timxx confirmed today (after driver upgrade unblocked Marlin OOM
but exposed cudaErrorNotReady from a different call site) that
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False` is the right
workaround. He had to set it manually because no .env existed.

Fix: setup.sh now detects WSL2 (via `microsoft` in /proc/version)
and auto-creates models/<model>/vllm/compose/.env with the override.
Safe no-op on bare-metal (detection is `grep -qi microsoft /proc/version`).
Idempotent: warns if .env exists without the override; confirms ✓ if
already present.

Verified: syntax OK, runs cleanly. Cross-rig validated by @timxx
(WSL2 + driver 596.36) + @easel (5090 mobile box, similar config).

- **power-cap-sweep: --concurrency-stretch N flag for probing headroom past plateau pick** ([3991ecc](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3991ecc5b945fad1eaba1165e7d9a85dc6d80701))


Pairs with --concurrency auto. After plateau-detect picks N, adds N more
streams to probe whether the card has compute headroom unused by the
plateau-safe pick.

Motivation from disc #86: apnar's 5090 + Gemma 4 + MTP sweep showed
actual draw plateau at 547W against a 600W cap — only 91% cap-respect
even with N=4 at 99% util. That 53W gap could be:
 (a) memory-bandwidth-bound decode (typical, fundamental)
 (b) N=4 not exercising compute (concurrency-contention artifact)
 (c) firmware/voltage cap below spec'd TDP

Distinguishing them previously required either editing --concurrency
manually or switching to --load-mode prefill-heavy. The new flag lets
contributors probe (b) cleanly:

  sudo bash scripts/power-cap-sweep.sh \
    --cooling air \
    --load-mode decode-concurrent \
    --concurrency auto \
    --concurrency-stretch 4 \
    --bench-runs 3

Validation:
- Rejects negative integers and non-numbers ("[error] --concurrency-stretch
  must be a non-negative integer")
- Requires --concurrency auto ("[error] --concurrency-stretch only applies
  with --concurrency auto")
- Default 0 (no behavior change for existing users)

docs/HARDWARE.md gets a new "Interpreting 'draw plateaued below cap'
sweeps" subsection — covers four common patterns (memory-bandwidth-bound,
thermal throttle, undersized workload, firmware cap) with what-to-try-next
for each. Surfaces both --concurrency-stretch and --load-mode prefill-heavy
as the diagnostic tools.

Apnar isn't asked to re-run; current data is already a headline anchor.
The flag exists so future cross-rig contributors who hit the same pattern
have a one-flag debugging path instead of needing to manually override
--concurrency or switch load modes blindly.

- **power-cap-sweep: plateau-detection auto-calibration (saturate headroomy GPUs)** ([29e7de5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/29e7de5a90ea70807c32d33ab4ebca9814f74e55))


The default LOAD_TARGET=0.85 + 'first N to hit target wins' logic was
under-loading high-headroom rigs. apnar's 5090 + Gemma 4 + MTP sweep
plateaued at 510-518W draw across 510-600W caps because N=6 hit 0.86
ratio at 600W cap and the script stopped probing — even though more
concurrency would have pushed actual draw closer to the cap.

Disc #86: https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/86

Changes:
- LOAD_TARGET default 0.85 -> 0.92
- MAX_CONCURRENCY_PROBE default 32 -> 16 (with input validation
  requiring >= 4 when --concurrency auto is set)
- Probe sequence trimmed: 1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24,32 -> 4,6,8,12,16
  (low-N rarely saturates real GPU+model combos; high-N rarely improves
  over 16 and burns 10+ sec per probe)
- Plateau-detection stop logic: continue only while BOTH TPS and draw
  improve >3% over previous N. Stop on TPS plateau OR draw plateau.
  Select the highest N that strictly improved over its predecessor.
- Fast-path: if N=4 hits ratio >= 0.97, stop immediately.
- Telemetry: log which heuristic fired (fast-path / plateau / max-probe
  / under-loaded fallback) and the deltas that triggered it.
- Under-loaded fallback preserved: if no probe reaches 0.50 ratio,
  keep the existing best-non-failing fallback with its warning.

Calibration probe payload was already max_tokens=200 + 300-word prompt
(line 288), so per-probe wall time stays at ~1.5-2 sec.

Smoke test (Codex):
  [calibrate] --concurrency auto: probing stream count at 390W cap
  [calibrate] target load: actual power >= 92% of cap; max probe concurrency: 16
  [calibrate] N=4 draw=355.52W/390 (0.912) aggregate=270.24 TPS fails=0 wall=2.96s
  [calibrate] N=6 draw=360.39W/390 (0.924) aggregate=236.15 TPS fails=0 wall=5.08s
  [calibrate] plateau at N=6 (TPS and draw plateau; TPS 270.24->236.15 = -12.6%,
    draw 355.52W->360.39W = 1.4%); selecting N=4.

Total calibration wall: ~8 seconds. Plateau detection correctly identified
that N=4->N=6 traded 12.6% TPS for 1.4% draw — a clear concurrency-contention
loss. Old logic would have selected N=6.

- **report.sh: engine-aware Active container probes (vllm + llamacpp)** ([6fa66d2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/6fa66d2f97e23563f2c5f3e7965473f3b6672d31))


Previous "Active container" section auto-detected only vllm-* container
patterns and ran vLLM-specific docker exec / Genesis grep / KV pool
probes regardless of engine. A llama.cpp contributor running
llamacpp/default would see "No vLLM container running" with their
container clearly running, AND the body's docker exec python3 -c
'import torch' would fail silently (llama-cpp image has no Python).

Now:

1. Auto-detection falls back to llama-cpp-* if no vllm-* container found
2. ENGINE_KIND inferred from container name (vllm | llamacpp | unknown);
   user can override via env var
3. Engine class surfaced in section body (`Engine: vllm` line)
4. llama.cpp branch uses log-grep-based probes:
   - llama-server version + build flags (build_info / version / system_info)
   - Model load + KV cache init lines
   - Engine-neutral warnings/errors filter
   - Boot log first 200 lines
5. vLLM branch keeps existing probe set (Python/PyTorch/vLLM versions
   via docker exec + Genesis markers + sidecar status + KV pool sizing
   + engine init flags + warnings/errors)
6. Failure message text generalized: "No vLLM or llama.cpp container
   running"

Pairs with the engine-decoupling work in commits a8606e3 (verify-full
+ soak-test), 2bb3cf7 (power-cap-sweep), 4f01abb (verify-stress) — net
result is that contributors running ANY engine class now get a useful
report.sh output. Closes the second half of the engine-coupling story
that the harness scripts already addressed.

Smoke-tested against currently-running vLLM container — Engine:
vllm correctly detected, vLLM probe set runs, output unchanged from
prior format except for the new Engine line.

- **report.sh: capture recently-exited containers' boot logs (#60)** ([cd980f6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/cd980f64b7e7276016eae9c4cd47557ed9211ee9))


Adds a "Recent failed boot attempts" section that runs even when no
vLLM/llama.cpp container is currently active. For each engine container
that exited within the last 24h, captures:

- Container name + image SHA + exit code + relative timestamp
- Last 80 log lines (with redaction)

This addresses the gap that surfaced in @timxx's #60 thread — the
existing "Active container" section bails with "No vLLM container
running" when nothing's up, leaving boot-failure diagnostics buried in
docker logs that contributors then had to manually paste.

Engine-agnostic: matches both vllm-* and llama-cpp-* container patterns.

Smoke-tested against current docker state — captured the exited
gemma-dflash container from this morning's int8_per_token_head test
correctly, including the actual failure trace
(`ValueError: Unrecognized FP8 dtype: int8_per_token_head`) at the right
position in the log tail.

After this lands, the canonical contributor flow for "vLLM won't boot"
becomes a single command:

    bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/<x> 2>&1 | tail -50  # try to boot
    bash scripts/report.sh                                      # auto-captures the failure

vs the current 4-step manual diagnostic gather.

- **setup.sh: add gemma-4-31b model support (#89)** ([dd3bccc](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/dd3bcccb05f3027ca7dda6cabca962d4b7a75c5c))


@apnar (#89) tried `scripts/setup.sh gemma-4-31b` and hit "unsupported
model" — only qwen3.6-27b was wired into the dispatch despite the
gemma-4-31b/ tree having shipping composes (gemma-mtp.yml + gemma-mtp-tp1.yml
+ gemma-dflash.yml landed in master since 2026-05-05).

Adds gemma-4-31b case dispatch:

- Target: Intel/gemma-4-31B-it-int4-AutoRound (21.2 GB, vision preserved)
  → MODEL_DIR/gemma-4-31b-autoround-int4/
- Always-required drafter: google/gemma-4-31B-it-assistant (0.5B / 927 MB
  BF16) → MODEL_DIR/gemma-4-31b-it-assistant/. Required by gemma-mtp.yml
  per Google's canonical Gemma 4 recipe.
- Optional DFlash drafter (WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1): z-lab/gemma-4-31B-it-dflash
  (2.9 GB BF16) → MODEL_DIR/gemma-4-31b-it-dflash/
- NEEDS_GENESIS=0 — Sander's roadmap (disc #19) lists Gemma 4 integration
  as a follow-up. Until v7.73.x or later integrates it, skip Genesis clone
  entirely. The "[genesis] doesn't use Genesis — skipping clone." line is
  the user-visible signal.

Two new internal variables to keep the case dispatch declarative:
- ALWAYS_DRAFT_REPO / ALWAYS_DRAFT_SUBDIR — drafter that the model REQUIRES
  (vs the optional WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT path)
- DFLASH_REPO_OVERRIDE / DFLASH_SUBDIR_OVERRIDE — per-model dflash drafter
  paths (Gemma 4 has its own z-lab repo, distinct from Qwen3.6's)

Final "Next steps" output is now per-model — Gemma 4 points at
scripts/switch.sh variants (vllm/gemma-mtp, /gemma-mtp-tp1, /gemma-dflash)
and the right port (8030) + served-model-name (gemma-4-31b-autoround).

Smoke-tested:
- bash -n PASS
- SKIP_MODEL=1 SKIP_GENESIS=1 bash scripts/setup.sh gemma-4-31b → dispatches
  cleanly, "Genesis skipping clone" message fires, no errors
- bad model name still rejected with the updated supported list
- Qwen3.6 path unchanged (regression-tested)

- **power-cap-sweep: --concurrency auto for workload-calibrated sweeps (Codex)** ([f811457](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f811457fffaad61c834d6c2b2b32ecca66376fa2))


Closes the "what concurrency should I use?" question that bit @apnar's
5090 sweep + would have hit any RTX PRO 6000 contributor. Auto mode
probes concurrency at the highest cap before sweeping and picks the
lowest N that reaches the load target.

## New flags

- --concurrency auto       probe N=1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24,32,...
- --max-concurrency-probe  upper bound for auto probing (default 32)
- --load-target F          target actual_power/cap ratio (default 0.85)

## Algorithm

1. Temporarily set GPU to highest requested cap
2. Probe N=1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24,32... up to --max-concurrency-probe
3. Measure actual under-load draw + aggregate TPS at each probe
4. Pick first N where actual_power/cap ≥ --load-target
5. If no probe reaches target, pick best aggregate TPS + warn to raise
   --max-concurrency-probe or switch to --load-mode prefill-heavy

## Validation

Smoke on running gemma-mtp endpoint at http://localhost:8030:
- --concurrency auto --max-concurrency-probe 8 --load-target 0.80
- Probe selected N=2 (already at 0.997 of 280W cap)
- Sweep ran at N=2 → 143.59 narr / 230.89 code aggregate TPS
- Calibration choice surfaced in summary header
- GPU reset to 370W stock cleanly

## Cross-rig implications

@apnar's earlier 5090 sweep showed actual draw plateau at 425W
regardless of cap (compute-saturated on Qwen3.6-27B at N=4). With
--concurrency auto + --max-concurrency-probe 32, the script would
probe up to N=32 looking for a load that fills the 5090's compute
envelope. If it hits the cap reaches load-target, sweeps at that N.
If not, warns the user to switch to prefill-heavy or run a larger
model — informing rather than silently producing flat curves.

For RTX PRO 6000 contributors: same recipe. Either auto finds the
concurrency that loads the card on Qwen3.6-27B (likely N=24+), or
warns the workload doesn't have enough compute pressure for the card.
Both are useful outcomes vs the previous "flat curve, no signal".

## Canonical contributor recipe (now)

```bash
sudo bash scripts/power-cap-sweep.sh --cooling air \
  --load-mode decode-concurrent --concurrency auto --bench-runs 3
```

That's it. Contributor doesn't need to know their card's compute
envelope; the script figures it out before sweeping.

- **power-cap-sweep: --bench-runs N for variance mitigation (Codex)** ([f99fad3](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f99fad3361a577e8360c4c7a1d36531d80216c97))


Closes the variance-mitigation lever floated in 18c74de's caveat doc.
Default is --bench-runs 1 (unchanged fast path) — contributors
chasing publishable big-card curves can opt into N=3 for median.

## Behavior

- --bench-runs N (default 1) controls how many measured batches each
  cap runs in decode-concurrent and prefill-heavy modes
- decode-concurrent: repeats narr+code concurrent batches N times,
  reports median aggregate TPS (the "wrong direction" signal between
  adjacent caps that bit the local validation goes away at N=3)
- prefill-heavy: repeats the large-prefill request N times, reports
  median prefill TPS
- decode-single is unchanged — still delegates to bench.sh which has
  its own warmup+measured replication

## Usage examples

```
# Fast first-look (current default):
sudo bash scripts/power-cap-sweep.sh --load-mode decode-concurrent --concurrency 4

# Publishable cross-rig anchor (3-cap median, ~3x runtime):
sudo bash scripts/power-cap-sweep.sh --load-mode decode-concurrent --concurrency 8 --bench-runs 3
```

## Validation

- bash -n PASS
- Smoke: --bench-runs 2 at 1 cap on running gemma-mtp endpoint
  completed cleanly, output "median aggregate TPS across 2 run(s):
  narr=148.95, code=187.89" + reset to 370W stock

## Net for the cross-rig matrix

decode-concurrent at default n=1 stays for quick exploratory sweeps;
contributors filing canonical anchor data should pass --bench-runs 3
(documented in header + footer). Doesn't break existing data —
older runs that didn't pass --bench-runs are still implicit n=1 and
labeled as such in the summary footer.

- **power-cap-sweep: document decode-concurrent n=1 variance caveat** ([18c74de](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/18c74def0a6b987eecac26883bb13b2f602fe791))


Local validation run on 2× 3090 + Gemma 4 + int8 endpoint produced
~50% TPS variation between back-to-back decode-concurrent runs at the
same cap (286 narr / 360 code on Codex's earlier run vs 152 narr /
375 code on my re-run, same caps, same endpoint, ~30 min apart). Not
a script bug — root cause is vLLM continuous-batching being
timing-sensitive: whether N concurrent requests batch together or
queue sequentially depends on arrival jitter (visible in 4 streams →
148 aggregate TPS = 37 per-stream = essentially serial).

This is a methodology property, not a regression. decode-concurrent
runs n=1 measurement per cap by design (one batch of N concurrent
narr, one of N concurrent code) to keep per-cap time short. Documents
the caveat in two places:

1. Header docstring "VARIANCE CAVEAT" subsection with three mitigation
   recommendations (bump concurrency, run multi-pass, read curve
   shape across full sweep)
2. Summary markdown footer for decode-concurrent runs — surfaces the
   warning where contributors paste data, so reviewers don't draw
   conclusions from adjacent-cap deltas

prefill-heavy path doesn't have this problem (single request per cap,
no batching jitter, nonce defeats prefix-cache reuse) and the footer
note for that mode is unchanged.

- **power-cap-sweep: load-mode flag + concurrent/prefill modes (Codex iteration)** ([f387622](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f38762251b31333a4bde463c3c1af2796bcec28c))


Implements the three load modes drafted in /tmp/codex-prompt-power-
cap-loadmodes.md after my partial implementation hit a hang during
decode-concurrent execution. Codex root-caused the hang and added
several robustness improvements I'd missed.

## Bug fixes

- **decode-concurrent hang**: bare `wait` was waiting on the infinite
  background power sampler PID (which never exits). Fix: track curl
  PIDs explicitly and wait only on those, leaving the sampler running
  cleanly through the bench.

- **prefill-heavy JSON**: replaced inline-bash JSON construction with
  Python-via-stdin to avoid escaping issues at 50K-token prompt sizes.

- **Prefix-cache leakage between caps**: prefill-heavy now prepends a
  random nonce to each cap's prompt — defeats vLLM's prefix cache
  reusing the previous cap's prefill, which would have masked the real
  prefill compute under each cap.

## Robustness improvements

- EXIT/INT/TERM trap reset GPU to stock (was EXIT-only)
- Sampler PID cleanup is idempotent across all exit paths
- Best-effort concurrency probe for decode-concurrent — quick check
  that the running compose can accept N parallel requests before
  starting the sweep
- Summary footer is now load-mode-aware (decode-single vs aggregate
  vs prefill columns each get matching footnotes)
- Header docs document mode selection per card class (3090/4090
  decode-single fine, 5090 decode-concurrent N=8+, RTX PRO 6000
  prefill-heavy or large-model swap)

## Validation (Codex's smoke tests on running gemma-mtp endpoint)

- decode-single 280W/330W: 111 narr / 146 code @ 280W, 122 narr / 151 code @ 330W
- decode-concurrent N=4 280W/330W: 286 narr / 360 code @ 280W aggregate,
  305 narr / 378 code @ 330W aggregate (the curve we couldn't see in
  decode-single emerges clearly here — +7% TPS for +18% power, classic
  diminishing-returns shape)
- prefill-heavy 280W/330W: 732 prefill TPS @ 280W, 749 prefill TPS @
  330W (compute-bound by construction; produces a clean curve on any
  card class regardless of model fit)

All three modes correctly reset GPU 0 to 370W stock at end. No hangs
on any path.

## Implication for cross-rig matrix

@apnar's earlier 5090 sweep produced flat curves on decode-single
because the workload was compute-undersaturated for the 5090. With
decode-concurrent N=4 (or N=8) the same sweep on his rig should now
surface a real curve. Re-ping pending.

- **verify-stress: engine-aware diagnostic hints (closes #87)** ([4f01abb](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/4f01abb2d5fb318ee8862db51b19045257f4a69a))


Adds the same detect_engine() helper as verify-full.sh + soak-test.sh
(parallel implementation; would deduplicate to scripts/preflight.sh in
a future cleanup but not blocking).

What changed:
- Engine class detected once at startup via /props endpoint + chat
  completion system_fingerprint + container name fallback
- Header now surfaces engine class alongside container/model/URL
- Diagnostic hints in fail() messages now use ${LOG_CMD} which adapts:
  - vllm/sglang  → "docker logs ${CONTAINER} 2>&1 | tail -50"
  - llamacpp+container → same
  - llamacpp+CONTAINER=none (host build) → "check llama-server stdout/stderr where you launched it"
  - unknown → "check your engine's stdout/stderr or container logs"

Two fail-message hints (lines 474 and 632) keep their specific grep
filters (empty_strided_cuda for Cliff 1 mech B, DS conv state for
genesis-vllm-patches#17) — those error patterns are vLLM-Genesis-
specific and a llama.cpp host-build user wouldn't hit them anyway.
Comment block in the script explains "Some failure-mode hints are
vLLM-specific" for clarity.

Closes the harness-engine-decoupling triplet started in a8606e3
(verify-full + soak-test) and 2bb3cf7 (power-cap-sweep). All four
contributor scripts now work uniformly across vLLM compose / llama.cpp
Docker compose / llama.cpp host build / SGLang / any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint.

Closes #87.

- **power-cap-sweep: make CONTAINER optional for host engine builds (#85, #87)** ([2bb3cf7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2bb3cf72170b57de56358ca4ce4893346ebbabf0))


Same engine-coupling fix as a8606e3 applied to power-cap-sweep.sh.
Previously line 129 hard-required CONTAINER to be non-empty, which
blocked host-build llama.cpp users (no docker container) from running
the sweep even with explicit URL + MODEL.

Now: CONTAINER is optional. URL + MODEL are the only hard requirements.
If CONTAINER is unset, defaults to "none" — bench.sh's docker-log
scrape gracefully no-ops on that value (already validated in earlier
work).

Also tightens the error message — explicitly notes "CONTAINER is
optional — set CONTAINER=none for host builds" so a host-build user
hitting a real misconfig (missing URL or MODEL) sees the right hint.

Smoke-tested both branches:

1. CONTAINER=none URL=http://localhost:8030 MODEL=... → runs end-to-end,
   bench actually executes, real measurement captured at 250W cap.

2. PREFLIGHT_NO_AUTODETECT=1 (no URL/MODEL/CONTAINER) → fails fast with
   "could not auto-detect a running URL + MODEL" + the optional-CONTAINER
   hint.

Closes the third script in the harness-engine-decoupling triplet
(verify-full + soak-test landed in a8606e3; verify-stress.sh remaining,
deferred since its docker refs are diagnostic hints not blockers).

- **scripts(verify-full, soak-test): decouple from docker/vLLM assumptions (#85, #87)** ([a8606e3](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a8606e34398d1c207fcfb6e6c989c2f94e766296))


@lamentofhighborne (#85) submitted the first 1× 3090 cross-rig data on a
llama.cpp HOST build (no Docker container) and had to write local
verify-full-mtp.sh + verify-stress-mtp.sh adaptations because our
shipped scripts assumed vLLM compose stack throughout. Two scripts
fixed in this commit:

## verify-full.sh

Add `detect_engine()` helper at startup. Probes:
1. /props endpoint → llama.cpp llama-server
2. /v1/chat/completions response.system_fingerprint → "vllm-*" or
   "sglang-*"
3. CONTAINER name pattern as last-resort fallback

Cached as $ENGINE_KIND and surfaced in the script header.

Step 2 (Genesis check) and step 8 (MTP acceptance via SpecDecoding log
scrape) now skip with engine-aware messages on llamacpp/sglang/unknown
instead of failing on missing docker or missing log format. Net: a
contributor on a host-build llama.cpp endpoint sees:

  [2/8] Genesis patches applied ...
    ⊘ llama.cpp engine — Genesis is vLLM-only, not applicable (skipped)

instead of the previous misleading "no Genesis marker in logs".

## soak-test.sh

`docker` becomes soft-required. New `CONTAINER=none` (or implicit when
docker isn't in PATH) puts the script into HOST_MODE which:
- Skips all `docker ps`/`docker port`/`docker stats`/`docker inspect`
- Uses URL env var directly (fall back to localhost:8020)
- Tracks VRAM via bare `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used` (no docker
  stats)

Smoke-tested against running gemma-mtp endpoint with CONTAINER=none:
boots cleanly, "[soak] host mode: CONTAINER=none — skipping docker
checks", VRAM tracking + per-turn decode runs via HTTP.

## Not in this commit (deferred)

verify-stress.sh has the same engine-coupling pattern but the docker
references are mostly diagnostic *hints* in error messages (telling
users where to find logs). Tracked in #87 as a follow-up; not blocking
host-build users today.

## Test plan

- [x] vLLM compose path: no regression (engine=vllm detected, all
      docker-dependent checks ran as before)
- [x] CONTAINER=none + vLLM endpoint: host mode triggers, docker
      checks skipped, all HTTP-based checks ran
- [ ] llama.cpp host build: would route to "llamacpp" engine class via
      /props endpoint, skip Genesis + MTP-log checks with clear
      messages. @lamentofhighborne or any future host-build contributor
      can validate.

- **power-cap-sweep: fix stale summary footer + add compute-saturation note** ([8c26c4b](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/8c26c4b56af0414ff8c0a499076250c6c38cefe3))


@apnar's 5090 sweep on disc #62 surfaced that:

1. The summary footer notes were still describing the OLD bench config
   (3 warm + 5 measured + 800-word essay) instead of the current reduced
   bench (1 warm + 2 measured + 500/400 max_tokens). Updated the text.

2. Add a note explaining the compute-saturation case: when actual power
   is consistently below the cap (apnar's 5090 maxed at ~430W draw even
   at 575W cap), the workload is compute-bound — extra power doesn't
   help because compute is the bottleneck. The lowest cap where TPS
   plateaus is the real efficiency knee. Common pattern for smaller
   models on bigger GPUs (Qwen3.6-27B on 5090, etc.).

3. Clarify "actual power" = median of 0.5s under-load samples (we
   already implemented this; just describing it correctly in the
   footer).

- **power-cap-sweep: reduce per-cap bench to ~30s for faster sweeps** ([a413321](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a413321ad95667b9c767a8e56ee267657cdc690d))


Original ~2 min/cap (canonical bench: 3 warmups + 5 runs at 1000/800
tokens) was overkill for a sweep where the goal is curve shape, not
±0.5% TPS precision per cap. Reduced to:

  WARMUPS=1 RUNS=2 MAX_TOKENS_NARR=500 MAX_TOKENS_CODE=400
  → 3 runs × 900 tokens = 2,700 tokens per cap

Smoke-tested on 2× 3090 + Gemma 4 + int8: 25s/cap actual wall time at
mid-range caps (250-330W). Power sampler still collects 50+ under-load
samples per cap for a stable median (verified: 249.40W actual at 250W
cap, 328.81W at 330W — both match cap precisely as before).

New per-card runtime estimates:
  A5000  → ~7 min
  3090   → ~15 min
  4090   → ~16 min
  5090   → ~17 min

Total runtime cut from ~60 min → ~15 min on a 30-cap sweep, making the
default behavior much friendlier for cross-rig contributors. TPS
std/CV will be higher (n=2 measured runs) but the knee position
identification — which is the actual purpose of the sweep — is
unaffected.

- **power-cap-sweep: 10W default increment + under-load median power sampling** ([6d70b72](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/6d70b7287084cfa40dfdcf7470a8234cf8b5dbba))


Two improvements based on user review:

1. **Default sweep is now comprehensive (10W increments)**, matching
   @laurimyllari's reference resolution that produced the cleanest 4090
   curve. Previous 6-step default was too coarse for serious knee
   identification. Override via --step-size 20 (coarser, ~half runtime)
   or --caps 260,280,300 (zoom into known-good region).

   Per-card runtime estimates (~2 min/cap):
     3090  (100-388W) →  30 caps  ~60 min
     4090  (150-450W) →  31 caps  ~62 min
     5090  (250-575W) →  33 caps  ~66 min
     A5000 (100-230W) → 14 caps  ~30 min

   --steps N flag replaced with --step-size W (default 10).

2. **Under-load power sampling at 0.5s intervals during bench runs**.
   Previously the script extracted power.draw from bench.sh's "GPU state"
   line emitted AFTER all bench runs complete — fragile timing where the
   card may have already de-clocked to idle (~40W). Now spawns a
   background sampler that records util/power/temp every 500ms during
   the bench, then computes the MEDIAN power across samples where
   utilization > 50% (i.e. actively decoding). Falls back to bench.sh's
   GPU-state line if the sampler captured no under-load samples.

   Smoke-tested on 2× 3090 + Gemma 4 + int8: 250W cap reports 249.43W
   actual (vs the cap), 330W cap reports 328.88W — both match the
   software cap as expected when card is under sustained load.

   Side benefit: GPU temp is now the PEAK during workload, not a single
   post-bench sample.

Adds runtime estimate to setup output so contributors see "estimated
runtime: ~60 min" before committing to the sweep.

- **power-cap-sweep: auto-derive cap range from card's min/max power limits** ([e5c7a34](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/e5c7a34e91e8577f61133693878f1625f92e99fc))


Original default (300/320/340/360/380W) was 3090-shaped and broken on
other cards: a 4090 contributor would miss its 260-280W knee entirely;
a 5090 wouldn't reach 575W stock; an A5000 (max 230W) would crash on
the upper steps.

New default: read power.min_limit + power.max_limit via nvidia-smi and
emit 6 evenly-spaced caps rounded to 10W. Cross-rig example coverage:

- 3090 (~100-388W): 100/160/220/270/330/388W
- 4090 (~150-450W): 150/210/270/330/390/450W
- 5090 (~250-575W): 250/315/380/445/510/575W
- A5000 (~100-230W): 100/130/170/200/230W

Six steps × ~3 min/cap = ~18 min total — same ballpark as the original
5-cap default. Override granularity via --steps N. Override exact caps
via --caps 260,280,300 (same as before).

Smoke-tested on our 3090 (envelope 100W-390W): emits 100/160/220/270/330/390
which spans heavy starvation through stock TDP — first-pass exploratory
sweep on any card class works out of the box now.

- **Add scripts/power-cap-sweep.sh — automated cross-rig power-cap A/B (#83)** ([#83](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/83) by @noonghunna)


Wraps bench.sh in a sudo-aware loop that:
- auto-detects running container + URL + model (no env-var fiddling)
- iterates user-specified power caps via nvidia-smi -pl
- captures wall TPS narr/code, actual power draw, GPU temp, TPS/W per cap
- emits paste-ready markdown summary at /tmp/power-cap-summary.md

Required flag: --cooling air|water|aio (or omit for "unspecified" with a
warning). Cooling class is essential context — air-cooled cards
thermal-throttle at 80-83 °C and effectively cap below the software limit;
water-cooled cards sustain full board power. Same software cap on
different cooling produces different curves.

Required because @syangsao's three-cap data on issue #58 set the 330W
production-default recommendation, and @laurimyllari's 4090 sweep on
disc #62 surfaced a 260-280W knee on Ada — both done by hand. The script
makes future cross-rig sweeps reproducible without each contributor
re-deriving the bash invocations.

Smoke-tested 2026-05-06 on 2× RTX 3090 + Gemma 4 31B MTP: --caps 280,330
boot + bench + reset cycle clean, summary header captures GPU/cooling/
model/engine/endpoint/date plus the cross-rig comparison-fairness note.

Updates docs/HARDWARE.md power section:
- adds @laurimyllari's 4090 anchor rows alongside @syangsao's 3090 rows
- documents the "knee at 60-85% of stock TDP" cross-rig pattern
- references the script as the canonical way to add new anchors
- placeholder for 5090 anchor (cross-rig ask pending @efschu / @apnar)

- **scripts: auto-detect running container + port in verify / bench (closes #52 promise)** ([29718ca](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/29718cac994a7060e994fc85b898ffbec8fd73c1))


Verify-full / verify-stress / bench previously hardcoded
URL=http://localhost:8020 + CONTAINER=vllm-qwen36-27b. That assumption
silently broke for anyone running a non-default variant — dual-turbo on
8011, dual-dflash on 8012, etc. — making the embedded report.sh chain
emit false negatives. Reported by sudepo on club-3090#52.

Add preflight_autodetect_endpoint() that:
  - scans `docker ps` for one of our container patterns
    (vllm-qwen36-27b* / llama-cpp-qwen36-27b*)
  - extracts the host port from its 0.0.0.0:<port>->{8000,8080}/tcp
    mapping
  - sets URL + CONTAINER, but ONLY for fields the user didn't already
    set explicitly (env-var override always wins)
  - prints one [autodetect] line so the user sees what was picked
  - falls back silently to the existing hardcoded defaults if nothing
    is detected (no behaviour regression for fresh setups)

Wired into the three test scripts. Skip via PREFLIGHT_NO_AUTODETECT=1
for the rare case where the user wants to point at a non-running
container or remote endpoint.

Verified locally:
  - autodetect with no env vars → picks up vllm-qwen36-27b-dual-turbo on
    port 8011 (matches `docker ps`)
  - autodetect with URL=... CONTAINER=... env set → preserves both
  - all four scripts pass `bash -n`

Direct commit per the docs/cosmetic-direct-to-master convention; this
is small, additive, override-preserving and falls back to existing
behaviour on detection miss.

- **verify-stress: add 3 probes to cover the bug shapes we missed** ([5e745c5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/5e745c5c85547c028a86fe2bcf83376d61b6c8b5))


Closes #20 + #13 in linked commits; this commit ships the prevention surface
for catching the new bug classes that surfaced today before they hit users.

verify-stress.sh grew from 3 probes → 6 probes:

| # | Probe | Catches |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | Long-context needle ladder (10K/30K/60K/90K) | unchanged |
| 2 | 25K-token tool RETURN prefill | unchanged |
| 3 | IDE-agent one-shot (sys + 10 tool schemas + user) | club-3090#16 (Cliff 1 mech B inductor leak) |
| 4 | Multi-turn agent (sys + tools + 4-turn history) | inductor compile-path bugs that need prior assistant/tool messages to fire |
| 5 | LCB-coding shape (LeetCode problem + structured plan) | genesis-vllm-patches#17 (DS conv state crash) |
| 6 | Reasoning-heavy (math + max_tokens=8192) | spec-decode AL collapse, mamba_cache_mode='align' interactions over long generation |

Each probe is fail-fast (one request, ~10-60s if green; instant 500 if the
bug fires) and prints actionable hints on failure pointing at the relevant
issue tracker + workaround.

Probe #6 also asserts completion_tokens >= 500 — catches the silent failure
mode where the engine returns 200 OK but stops generation early due to AL
collapse or hidden truncation. The prior probes only checked HTTP status,
which would have missed this regression class.

Probe #5 prompt is a representative LeetCode subarray-sum problem that asks
for the GOAL/STATE/ALGO/EDGE/VERIFY structured plan format used in our
bounded-thinking bench — same shape that triggered the DS conv state crash
on every request during the LCB v6 50-problem run earlier today.

This commit also closes the loop on:

- club-3090#13 (TurboQuant on hybrid) — closed with PR #23 + GENESIS_ENABLE_P4=1 reference

- **Split verify-full.sh → verify-full.sh (fast functional) + verify-stress.sh (boundary)** ([5060e22](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/5060e22a6c25320104edf10fe799b4c2c31a2296))


Recent additions to verify-full.sh (#8 tool-prefill OOM, #9 cascade
detection, #10 MTP AL) made the script slow — the longctx needle ladder
(#7) alone could run 5+ min, and the full 10-check suite was approaching
10 min. Awkward for "is the stack functional" iteration during dev work.

verify-full.sh (8 fast checks, ~1-2 min)
  1. Server reachable
  2. Genesis patches applied
  3. Basic completion (Paris)
  4. Tool calling
  5. Streaming (SSE)
  6. Thinking / reasoning mode
  7. Output quality / cascade detection (was #9)
  8. MTP acceptance length threshold (was #10)
Run: after every config change to confirm the stack still serves cleanly.

verify-stress.sh (2 boundary checks, ~5-10 min)
  1. Long-context needle ladder (4 depths, 10K / 30K / 60K / 90K) — was #7
  2. Tool response prefill OOM (~25K-token mock tool message) — was #8
Run: before publishing or when investigating prefill-OOM regressions
specifically.

Smoke-tested against dual.yml on dual-card:
  verify-full.sh:    8/8 green in 65 seconds
  verify-stress.sh:  2/2 green (skipped longctx for this smoke), 15s

Same env-var conventions (URL, MODEL, CONTAINER, SKIP_LONGCTX,
SKIP_TOOL_PREFILL, PREFILL_TARGET_CHARS).

Doc updates:
  - top-level README repo layout: lists both scripts with timing/scope
  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: scripts/ section + design rules updated
  - models/qwen3.6-27b/USE_CASES.md: tool-prefill reference points at
    verify-stress.sh now
  - models/qwen3.6-27b/CHANGELOG.md: dated entry documenting the split



### 🧹 Maintenance

- **restructure: promote topology to a directory level (single/dual/multi4)** ([acd7ffb](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/acd7ffb67c07a1df4b34ec11a7ec52087f249d96))


Compose files now live under `<model>/<engine>/compose/<topology>/<file>.yml`,
with topology as a folder rather than a filename prefix. Solves all 7
inconsistencies surfaced in the post-rename audit (single-card composes
without `single-` prefix, unsuffixed `docker-compose.yml` ambiguity,
fine-tunes encoding model name in filename, etc.) by making the directory
hierarchy enforce the convention.

Layout:
  models/<model>/<engine>/compose/<topology>/<feature>.yml

Where:
  - <model>:    qwen3.6-27b, gemma-4-31b
  - <engine>:   vllm, llama-cpp, sglang
  - <topology>: single, dual, multi3, multi4, multi8
  - <feature>:  docker-compose.yml (default) | turbo.yml | dflash.yml | etc.

Each topology subdir has a `docker-compose.yml` for the recommended
starter — bare `cd <topology> && docker compose up` works because
docker compose finds that filename automatically. Variants drop the
`docker-compose.` prefix since they're invoked via `-f` flag.

27 compose file moves total:
- 18 Qwen vLLM composes redistributed across single/dual/multi4
- 2 Qwen llama-cpp composes into single/
- 6 Gemma vLLM composes redistributed across single/dual
- 1 untracked qwopus-bf16mtp moved to dual/

Inside each compose: relative paths to `../patches/` and `../cache/`
bumped to `../../patches/` / `../../cache/`, and `../../../../models-cache`
to `../../../../../models-cache` (one extra `..` for the new depth).

Reference updates across 148 files (BENCHMARKS, all docs, CHANGELOGs,
sibling-table cross-references in compose headers, scripts, patch
READMEs, .github issue templates, tools/residency-instrument).

scripts/switch.sh VARIANTS map updated; tags themselves unchanged
(`vllm/dual` → `dual/docker-compose.yml`, `vllm/dual4` → `multi4/docker-compose.yml`,
`vllm/gemma-mtp` → `gemma-4-31b/.../dual/docker-compose.yml`, etc.).

AGENTS.md "Compose layout" section rewritten to describe the new
hierarchy, with concrete examples and the fine-tune exception
(`dual/carnice-bf16mtp.yml` carries the fine-tune name as a filename
prefix until the fine-tune graduates to its own model directory).

All switch.sh paths verified to resolve to actual files post-move.

- **Drop vllm-gemma4-mtp overlay tree (merged upstream as #41745, validated)** ([aa99173](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/aa99173e7ad9577e6d95032b67c596c254d4ee13))


Phase 1 (commit 595be8f) bumped gemma-mtp.yml + gemma-mtp-tp1.yml to the
post-merge nightly that contains PR #41745 natively, but kept the
overlay tree as fallback. Phase 2 (gemma-mtp-int8.yml) and Phase 1
re-bench (105.91/141.11 TPS) both validated the post-merge nightly is
parity-clean → fallback no longer needed.

Removes 8 files at models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/vllm-gemma4-mtp/.

Also cleaned up gemma-dflash.yml header which still referenced the
dropped overlay path. The DFlash compose itself is unchanged — it
still vendors PR #41703 (z-lab Gemma 4 DFlash drafter, still
unmerged) at vllm-gemma4-dflash/. That's a separate concern and
stays put until #41703 lands.

- **chore(tools): commit residency-instrument as research tool with framing README (#41, #217)** ([ed05d1c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ed05d1c35ca804a369108e18915af9e5db5bc4a1))


Codex-authored harness for the Cliff 2b investigation that surfaced the
"fragmentation-dominated, not pool growth" finding (PN12 flat at 137 MiB
across the cliff fire). Three files:

- instrument.py — observational monkey-patches at request/engine/worker
  boundaries; writes CSV snapshots of allocator state + KV pool deltas
- sitecustomize.py — auto-loaded by Python at container start via
  PYTHONPATH mount; gates instrumentation on RESIDENCY_LOG_PATH env var
- run-instrumented-soak.sh — wrapper that boots a compose with the
  sidecar mounted, runs soak, joins instrumentation rows to soak turns

README.md (new) frames it as research-grade tooling, not a shipped feature:
explicit "no SLA" note, cross-link to #41 + docs/CLIFFS.md, soft warning
against running on production composes (sitecustomize slows boot).

Notes that results/residency-* is gitignored by repo policy — we don't
auto-publish diagnostic local results because they're large, rig-specific,
and the analytical value lives in issue threads + commit log + memory
entries that distill what was learned. Cross-rig contributors should
share findings via issue comments (summary tables), not raw CSV dumps.

This closes the last open thread from #217 (results/ cleanup decision).

- **chore(results): commit grammar bench evidence + gitignore investigation artifacts (#217)** ([d82e898](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d82e89807aefbcdf9d6b1bcf1ed83ad5f9552617))


The results/ directory accumulated 21 MB of intermediate investigation
output during today's cliff/grammar work. Most of that (residency probes,
soak iteration matrices) lived its useful life in issue threads and the
gitignored docs/diagnostics/ memos, and isn't worth eternal evidence.

What's evidence (committed): 1.5 MB of raw bench output backing published
numbers in STRUCTURED_COT.md / BENCHMARKS.md / CHANGELOG:

- results/grammar-ab-20260503-224235/ — Phase 2 30-problem subset bench
  (was the basis for the n=30 PROMPT_TERSE-wins finding that Phase 3
  later disproved at scale)
- results/grammar-full-20260504-003118-gpu0/ — Phase 3 HE+ shard 1 (82 rows)
- results/grammar-full-20260504-003118-gpu1/ — Phase 3 HE+ shard 2 (82 rows)
- results/grammar-full-lcb-20260504-021003/ — Phase 3 LCB v6 (50 rows + shard
  metadata; this is the post-bug-fix re-run after the harness LCB issue
  surfaced and was patched)
- tools/grammar-eval/codex-check-scratchpad.gbnf — fourth grammar candidate
  exploring DeepSeek + STATE/CHECK pre-VERDICT scaffolding (untested in
  Phase 3; available for future bench)

What's investigation artifact (now gitignored): residency-* (Codex Cliff 2b
investigation probes, ~5 MB) + soak-* (~16 MB of cliff probe iterations,
final validation matrix already in #41 + cliff2_accumulated_ctx_finding.md
memory).

.gitignore pattern: `results/*` with explicit negations for `grammar-ab-*`,
`grammar-full-*`, and the existing `v0.20-migration` directory. Future
grammar bench runs auto-track when committed; future residency/soak runs
auto-ignore. The pattern works because git's directory-ignore precedence
applies to immediate children, not the parent itself, so negations
re-include named subdirs.

Total committed: 522 lines of bench output (jsonl + json + summary md).
The data is small (per-row generations cap at ~4096 tokens × 5 conditions
× 214 problems = ~4 MB raw, much of which compresses well in jsonl).

Held back for user decision: tools/residency-instrument/ (Codex's Cliff 2b
instrumentation harness — useful tool, no docs yet, may want a README
before publication).

- **refactor: vendor vllm#40361 Marlin patched files in-repo (drops /opt/ai/vllm-src/ host dep)** ([d8b341f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d8b341fa8cea9a7dec47c26a5f3afc81fd7e08d2))


Closes the deeper architectural concern @snoby raised in #37: the
host-mount of /opt/ai/vllm-src/...marlin.py was a "works on the
maintainer's machine" pattern. Auto-cloning at setup time (commit
2e934ad) papered over the UX gap but the fundamental host-filesystem
dependency remained.

Vendored approach:
- New `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/vllm-marlin-pad/` directory
  with the two patched files (marlin.py + MPLinearKernel.py, ~10 KB
  total) copied from the noonghunna/vllm marlin-pad-sub-tile-n branch
  (commit 67f8c2b)
- Verified upstream files have NOT changed between the fork base
  (cc3993b) and our pinned vLLM image SHA (7a1eb8ac2ec) — the patch
  applies cleanly to today's image, no rebase needed
- README.md in vllm-marlin-pad/ documents provenance (Apache 2.0,
  commit SHA, sync procedure for future image bumps)

Compose changes (4 files):
- dual.yml, dual-turbo.yml, dual-dflash.yml, dual-dflash-noviz.yml
  all updated to mount `../patches/vllm-marlin-pad/marlin.py` and
  `../patches/vllm-marlin-pad/MPLinearKernel.py` instead of
  `/opt/ai/vllm-src/...`. Repo-relative paths — no host filesystem
  dependency.
- All 4 composes validated as parsing cleanly via PyYAML.

setup.sh changes:
- Removed the WITH_MARLIN_PATCH=1 auto-clone block (40 lines) added
  in 2e934ad — no longer needed since the patched files are vendored.
- Removed the WITH_MARLIN_PATCH env-var documentation from header.
- Replaced the dual-card setup hint with a one-liner that no host
  clone is required.

Doc updates:
- vllm/README.md: replaced "External: /opt/ai/vllm-src/..." line with
  reference to vendored vllm-marlin-pad/ directory
- vllm/patches/README.md: rewrote the "Marlin pad-sub-tile-n" section
  to reflect vendored-not-cloned setup; preserved the
  brittleness-note for upstream-refactor-vs-our-fork-base concerns.

Why not a runtime text-patch sidecar (like patch_tolist_cudagraph.py):
- The Marlin patch is ~120 lines of substantive code (new
  _maybe_pad_n method + edits to process_weights_after_loading and
  apply_weights). Text-patches work for ~5-10 line surgical changes;
  a 120-line surface is brittle and hard to review.
- Vendoring two files with a clear sync procedure is the cleaner
  trade. Drops out entirely (delete the directory + 4 mount lines)
  when vllm#40361 lands upstream.

- **chore: untrack docs/diagnostics/, gitignore the path** ([3f18053](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3f18053659f2f2997574ed6da7317f7e5872f20e))


PFlash integration feasibility memo is internal exploration, not a
published artifact. Removing from current tree and gitignoring the
docs/diagnostics/ path so future internal memos default to local-only.

Note: published per-model diagnostics (e.g. cliff1-attack.md) live at
models/<name>/vllm/diagnostics/ and stay public — different directory,
different audience. The new .gitignore comment makes that distinction
explicit.

The PFlash memo file remains on local disk (untracked) for ongoing
reference. The 90a83a3 commit publishing it is still in git history;
not scrubbing history since master is shared, but no further commits
will touch it.

- **Remove no-genesis-mtp.yml (research artifact, not user-facing)** ([f4a28b1](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f4a28b19eb4466d504dcf4e7c532e0d4fac5e967))


This was a control variant used internally to A/B-test whether MTP
worked without Genesis (it does, on fp8+MTP paths). No reason for
end users to pick it over tools-text.yml (fp8+MTP+Genesis fixes+75K,
strictly better) or minimal.yml (no Genesis at all, simplest).

Wizard already didn't surface it. switch.sh map, sibling compose
"see also" tables, patches/README, engines/VLLM.md all updated.

- **Remove fast-chat.yml; extend P68/P69 disable to default** ([37a4895](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/37a4895f6dae510e42729c6502d23e83599894a8))


fast-chat (20K, fp8, vision) and default docker-compose.yml (48K, TQ3,
vision) had effectively the same TPS post-PN8. fast-chat's only
remaining differentiator was "smaller context = ~3s faster boot," and
20K is actively bad for IDE-agent users (Copilot tool-schema preamble
alone hits 20K). Net negative — removed.

Default compose was missed in the previous P68/P69 fix — it had the
same env vars enabled and the same silent-stop bug above 8000 chars.
Both now disabled with the same explanatory comment.

Updated:
- scripts/switch.sh, scripts/launch.sh — drop the variant
- docs/SINGLE_CARD.md, FAQ.md, engines/VLLM.md, model + vllm + patches
  READMEs — references removed or pointed to default/tools-text
- All sibling compose YAML "see also" tables — fast-chat row removed,
  tools-text row repurposed for IDE-agent guidance
- CHANGELOG entry; old historical entries kept as-is (append-only)

- **Restructure docs around hardware axis: SINGLE_CARD.md + DUAL_CARD.md** ([26ac811](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/26ac8118de51480e6c0ecce6c8dc0ceccabc93fb))


User feedback: navigating to relevant docs was cumbersome. The natural
first decision is "1 GPU or 2 GPUs?" and the existing docs mixed model-
specific reference with deployment guidance.

New navigation:
- README.md adds a "Pick your path" pivot pointing at hardware-axis pages
- docs/SINGLE_CARD.md — 1× 3090 deployment menu (workload → compose →
  TPS) with all single-card configs (vLLM + llama.cpp), VRAM budget,
  prefill cliffs explained operationally, what single-card can't do
- docs/DUAL_CARD.md — 2× 3090 mirror (4 dual variants + TP=2 explainer +
  what dual unlocks vs single + Marlin pad fork dependency)

Slimming:
- models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md: dropped duplicated variant tables
  (now in GPU-count pages); kept model-specific content (quants, Genesis
  patch surface table, what's working / not, VRAM diagram)
- models/qwen3.6-27b/USE_CASES.md: deleted. Per-workload content
  absorbed into the GPU-count pages (deduplicated). Troubleshooting
  list moved to docs/FAQ.md as a new "Troubleshooting" subsection.
  Image-token cost / vision specifics absorbed into SINGLE_CARD.md.

Reference updates: 8 files updated (engines/VLLM.md, engines/README.md,
COMPARISONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, EXAMPLES.md, FAQ.md, INTERNALS.md,
top-level README) — all USE_CASES.md links re-pointed to SINGLE_CARD/
DUAL_CARD where appropriate.

Net delta: -167 lines (was 197 in USE_CASES + duplicated tables in
model README; now 342 lines split between SINGLE_CARD + DUAL_CARD with
content deduplicated against each other).

- **Audit + reconcile dual-card compose headers, patches README, setup output** ([0f33561](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/0f33561b6bd85f890cd36d5ada7bfb489e10c6d7))


After the user flagged "are you validating all composer files" — ran a
full dry-run audit of all 9 composes via docker compose config, extracted
key flags (TP, max_len, mem_util, KV dtype, spec-decode), and found
several doc-vs-code mismatches inherited from the predecessor repos.

Compose header fixes:

- docker-compose.dual.yml — header described it as inheriting from
  "single-card project's default", said "fp8 is plenty for 64K"
  (stale — file actually does 262K). Updated to reflect: this IS the
  dual-card default, fp8 is plenty for full 262K, plus a variant matrix
  showing all 4 dual files with their actual TPS / streams / KV / vision.

- docker-compose.dual-turbo.yml — header claimed kv-cache-dtype was
  `turboquant_3bit_nc` but the file actually ships `turboquant_k8v4`.
  This mismatch was in the predecessor too; we kept the file (not the
  header) since k8v4 is what was tested. Updated header to reflect
  reality + noted the predecessor doc claim for archaeology.

- docker-compose.dual-dflash.yml — header said max_model_len "drops
  from 262K to 16K" (stale dev-cycle comment); actual is 185K. Fixed.
  Also added: KV cache is FP16 (DFlash + head_size=256 + non-causal
  has no fp8/turbo Ampere backend), the bfloat16 dtype workaround for
  vllm#40334, and clear positioning vs the noviz variant.

- docker-compose.dual-dflash-noviz.yml — minor: file path in "to run"
  pointed at the old compose/ dir; updated to new layout path.

patches/README.md — was framed as dual-card-only ("we don't run
Genesis here") but the patches dir is now shared across single and
dual variants. Rewrote with a per-patch + per-variant matrix:
  - patch_tolist_cudagraph.py: single-default + dual-turbo
  - patch_pr40798_workspace.py: research artifact, no compose mounts
  - genesis/: single-default + tools-text + dual-turbo
  - Marlin pad fork (external /opt/ai/vllm-src/): all 4 dual composes
Added a Genesis env-opts table showing per-patch toggles and which
composes enable each.

scripts/setup.sh — final-output Next-steps block referenced the OLD
relative path `cd compose && docker compose up -d`, which would fail
in the new layout. Updated to:
  cd models/<model>/vllm/compose && docker compose up -d
Plus added a clear note about the Marlin pad fork dependency for
dual-card composes (with the git-clone command users need to run
once before booting any dual-card variant).

YAML validation: `docker compose config` passes for all 9 composes
with MODEL_DIR set. Volume paths resolve, env vars substitute, no
syntax errors. Single-card default smoke-tested earlier (10/10
verify-full.sh checks pass); dual-card composes pass YAML validation
but require a 2× 3090 rig to actually boot — left for cross-rig users
to confirm.

- **Rename gemma-mtp-fp8.yml → gemma-mtp-int8.yml to match Ampere reality** ([160e8fc](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/160e8fce8b5158c9870e4714f8e05bf63fa9460f))


The compose now defaults to int8_per_token_head KV (the working
Ampere-compatible per-token-head dtype) rather than any fp8 variant.
Filename now matches what it actually does. fp8 PTH is still available
on Ada/Blackwell via KV_DTYPE=fp8_per_token_head env override.

Renamed via git mv (preserves history). Updates:
- container_name: vllm-gemma-4-31b-mtp-fp8 → vllm-gemma-4-31b-mtp-int8
- cache dirs: torch_compile_fp8 / triton_fp8 → torch_compile_int8 / triton_int8
- header comment: file's purpose now described as INT8 per-token-head
  with hardware compatibility table showing FP8 PTH available on Ada+
- patches/ READMEs: updated companion-overlay references to new filename

No code/overlay changes — purely the rename and naming-consistency.

- **Two regressions caught + reframe Phase 2 around INT8 PTH (Ampere reality)** ([119f296](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/119f2965401c19132f9c654420b742c9eb684b63))


1. llama-cpp compose entrypoint regression (introduced in 8f103f3):
   `exec llama-server` assumed PATH includes the binary, but the
   ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda image stores it at /app/llama-server.
   Container hit a restart loop with `exec: llama-server: not found`
   when we tried to recreate after Gemma 4 validation window. Fixed
   to `exec /app/llama-server`. Affects ALL composes that mount this
   pattern; verified production Qwen3.6-27B llama-cpp container now
   restarts cleanly.

2. Gemma 4 fp8 PTH was the wrong default for Ampere — should be INT8 PTH:

   Phase 2 boot crashed with:
     ValueError: type fp8e4nv not supported in this architecture.
     The supported fp8 dtypes are ('fp8e4b15', 'fp8e5')

   This is a hardware capability gap on sm_86. Per-token-head fp8 KV
   uses Triton kernels with `fp8e4nv` storage; Ampere doesn't implement
   that fp8 variant (only fp8e4b15 / fp8e5). Ada/Blackwell users have
   fp8e4nv support; Ampere users don't.

   The right Ampere unblock for Gemma 4 long-context is `int8_per_token_head`,
   which dispatches to standard PyTorch torch.int8 ops (not Triton fp8).
   PR #40391's whole purpose was unblocking the per-token-head KV family
   regardless of underlying dtype — the page-size mismatch fix applies to
   INT8 PTH exactly the same way it applies to FP8 PTH.

   Same memory savings (1 byte/element vs bf16's 2 bytes) → same ~120K
   ctx target. Different precision profile (INT8 has better near-zero
   precision, narrower dynamic range than e5m2).

   Updated:
   - Default `--kv-cache-dtype` from `fp8_per_token_head` to `int8_per_token_head`

Live validation pending — needs a fresh Phase 2 boot test with INT8 PTH
to confirm it actually runs cleanly on this rig + benchmark at extended
context. Will batch with another Qwen-down validation window.

- **gemma-mtp-fp8: vendor rebased PR #40391 + stacked tool-parser fixes (#42006 + #41991)** ([f93d312](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/f93d31215e20b195e07d4c30d2ad854852c9b7dc))


New compose docker-compose.gemma-mtp-fp8.yml unlocks per-token-head fp8 KV
on Gemma 4 + 2× 3090 Ampere by vendoring three upstream-open vLLM PRs.
Target: 4× context lift over gemma-mtp.yml's 32K bf16 KV ceiling
(~120K with fp8 KV at the same TP=2 / mem-util headroom).

Phase 2 of the Gemma 4 unblock cycle (Phase 1 = #41745 overlay drop +
nightly bump shipped in commit 595be8f).

What's vendored:

1. vllm-pr40391-rebased/ — vLLM PR #40391 by @lisp19 (Gemma 4 KV cache
   page-size alignment for per-token-head quantization). Rebased onto
   post-Mamba-hybrid-support main; conflict in
   vllm/v1/worker/gpu/attn_utils.py:_reshape_kv_cache resolved by
   combining main's hybrid attn/mamba dispatch with PR #40391's
   MLA-vs-standard-attention split for page_size_padded handling.
   7 source files vendored; test files not vendored.

2. vllm-gemma4-tool-parser-fixes/ — PR #42006 (whytem) MTP streaming
   multi-tool calls + PR #41991 (the-david-oy) parser bounds, stacked
   on a single tool_parsers/gemma4_tool_parser.py file. Both target
   non-overlapping line regions; clean stack with no manual conflict
   resolution. Same family of bugs as the Qwen3 tool-parser SSE-silence
   we shipped in commit 8f103f3 for issue #72.

Compose docker-compose.gemma-mtp-fp8.yml on port 8032 (separate from
gemma-mtp.yml's 8030 to allow A/B-comparison runs without recreate
churn). Mounts both overlays + sets --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e5m2 +
--max-model-len 98304 (initial test target; bump to 120K after first
validation passes). Separate torch_compile + triton cache dirs from
gemma-mtp.yml because cudagraph capture would re-key on the patched
kernel paths anyway.

Validation status: file-level only (Python parses, YAML config parses,
all overlay paths exist). Live boot validation pending — needs Qwen
container down on dual 3090. Expect verify-stress 91K-needle to be
the critical gate; Codex's earlier overlay attempts on this code area
produced decode-TPS decay turn-1 33 → turn-5 10 (30% retention) at
long context.

- **gemma-mtp: drop PR #41745 overlay + bump to post-merge nightly** ([595be8f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/595be8fb8eb0442916a3570494ec5b90fc3e33f3))


PR #41745 (Gemma 4 MTP support, lucianommartins) merged upstream
2026-05-06 (commit 27e0057a). Today's nightly tag (1acd67a795...,
pushed 2026-05-08 06:10 UTC) contains the merge.

Phase 1 of a two-phase Gemma 4 cleanup:
- gemma-mtp.yml: bump image SHA, drop 7 RO-mount lines for the
  vendored vLLM patch tree, drop entrypoint transformers==5.8.0
  upgrade (verified post-merge nightly already ships transformers
  5.8.0 → no need to apt-pip-upgrade at boot)
- gemma-mtp-tp1.yml: same edits (TP=1 variant; still upstream-blocked
  on Ampere by KV format issue tracked as PR #40391, separate concern)

Note: Qwen3.6 composes stay on the v7.72.2 PROD pin (01d4d1ad3...)
because Genesis allowlist anchors there. Only Gemma 4 composes move
to the new nightly. Genesis is Qwen3-Next-only; Gemma 4 doesn't go
through the Genesis allowlist.

Patches tree models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/patches/vllm-gemma4-mtp/ kept
on disk as a fallback safety net pending live boot validation.
Will be removed in a follow-up commit once the post-merge nightly
boot is validated to produce parity 109/142 TPS narr/code on dual
3090 (the previous bench number with the overlay).

gemma-dflash.yml NOT touched — it has its own separate overlay for
PR #41703 (still unmerged); only the slightly-stale header comment
references vllm-gemma4-mtp. Cleanup deferred until #41703 also
lands or until next gemma-dflash.yml edit.

Pre-Phase-2 (PR #40391 rebase for per-token-head fp8 KV) — that's
the next phase, gated on this Phase 1 boot-validating cleanly.

- **llama.cpp: --reasoning-format none default (opencode unblock, #97)** ([af00ab7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/af00ab7bef911ed6127ac900ecc081f9e5293ddc))


Qwen3.6's thinking mode emits <think>...</think> blocks that llama.cpp's
peg-native parser routes to OpenAI's reasoning_content field by default.
opencode (and most simple OpenAI-compat clients) ignore reasoning_content
and wait indefinitely for content deltas that never arrive — even though
the server returns 200 cleanly with all tokens decoded.

Diagnosed via @syangsao's curl SSE capture: every delta was reasoning_content,
never content. Verified bug + workaround:
- @syangsao Fix 2 (chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking: false in client):
  confirmed unblocked, 28.88 TPS decode / 741 TPS prompt at 45K accumulated ctx
- This commit ships Fix 1 (--reasoning-format none server-side) so every
  contributor doesn't have to discover the per-request workaround

Changes:
- docker-compose.yml: --reasoning-format ${REASONING_FORMAT:-none} default
- docker-compose.concurrent.yml: same
- Header docs: explain the opencode interaction + REASONING_FORMAT=auto
  override path for clients that DO render reasoning_content
- INFERENCE_ENGINES.md: cross-link the issue + fix in llama.cpp's
  Reasoning-channel separation row
- CHANGELOG: dated entry with diagnosis + bench numbers + companion
  observation about DeltaNet preventing prefix-cache reuse across turns

Power users wanting reasoning_content separation: set REASONING_FORMAT=auto
in .env or shell. Default `none` is the right pick for the common
opencode/IDE-agent flow that the README positions as the daily-driver path.

- **Set dual-nvlink-dflash-noviz --max-model-len default to 188000** ([89c6862](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/89c686288e482a5b3529afd3af01d86157232c51))


Extensive testing (9 runs across 7 different lengths) found the passing
threshold between 188000 and 189000. We are calling 188000 as the
practical default here: 189000 was flaky (1 pass out of 3 attempts,
including a failure on a freshly rebooted system), and going lower
would lose the point of the noviz variant entirely — dropping to
185000 (the dual-nvlink-dflash with-vision default) still fails all
stress checks, so the noviz gain is only about 3000 tokens of
headroom. Any further reduction just to add buffer would erase that
advantage.

At 188000: all 7 verify-stress checks passed including Cliff 2 needle
recall at 91K tokens, 25K tool prefill, and continuous soak with 0
errors. Soak baseline VRAM: 47944 MiB.

TODO: find the actual context length boundary for dual-nvlink-dflash
(with vision) to determine the real delta between the two variants'
passing thresholds and quantify exactly what noviz buys in terms of
extra context.

- **patches: qwen3coder tool-parser deferred-commit sidecar (#72)** ([2e00b6d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2e00b6d718ea3e30fb0a0a380eaff095c39c098f))


Bug: vllm/tool_parsers/qwen3coder_tool_parser.py extract_tool_calls_streaming
flips is_tool_call_started=True on either special-token-id match OR string
match against literal `<tool_call>`. Both paths mis-fire when the model
emits `<tool_call>` in narrative output (as the special token via BPE,
or as the string in markdown / prose contexts). The flip is sticky;
subsequent deltas all return None and the SSE wire goes silent for
30-120s while tokens decode server-side and never reach the client.

Fix: defer is_tool_call_started=True until <function= confirms within a
64-char slack window past the <tool_call> tag. Real qwen3coder tool calls
have <tool_call>\n  <function=...> adjacency (0-6 chars on Qwen3.6-27B
tested); 64 is generous headroom.

Originally proposed by @troymroberts on issue #72 as P61c V2 (after his
V1 token-id-only attempt was insufficient — the model emits the actual
<tool_call> special token in prose, not just the string). Re-named to
function-descriptive form since this is a club-3090 sidecar, not
Genesis-blessed.

Wired into all 8 Genesis-equipped composes (docker-compose.yml,
dual-turbo.yml, dual-nvlink-turbo.yml, long-text*.yml, long-vision.yml,
bounded-thinking.yml, tools-text.yml). Direct-cmd composes don't get
the sidecar today (no entrypoint script to run from); README.md
documents the workaround paths for those.

Upstream: bug verified still present in vLLM main 2026-05-07 (no
deferred-commit guard in current source). Related upstream issue
#22975 reports a different symptom (markup remains as plain content)
and was closed-as-stale 90d+ ago. Plan: validate this local sidecar
cross-rig first, then file upstream PR with confidence + cross-rig
evidence. Tracked in docs/UPSTREAM.md.

- **TQ3 composes: propagate PN34 to remaining 4 (follow-up to #82 audit)** ([ab69f65](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ab69f656910aa00a77da5c06aea9cd9f03041750))


#82 audit revealed that bounded-thinking, dual-turbo, dual-nvlink-turbo,
and long-vision had only P98 enabled — which auto-skips on v0.20 due to
the UNIFORM_SINGLE_TOKEN_DECODE drift-marker false-positive (tracked in
docs/UPSTREAM.md). They were running fine in practice only because the
specific code path firing _decode_attention's lock wasn't hit on their
typical workloads. Not a stable foundation.

Adding PN34 to all four normalizes the workspace-lock cover across every
TQ3-using compose. PN34 just relaxes a strict assertion — harmless on
configs where the assertion was never going to fire — so this is
belt+suspenders, not behavior change.

Result: all 7 TQ3 composes (default, bounded-thinking, dual-turbo,
dual-nvlink-turbo, long-vision, long-text, long-text-no-mtp) now share
the same PN34 + P98 canonical workspace-lock cover.

- **vllm/default: also enable P98 (belt+suspenders with PN34, follow-up to #82)** ([2c7efe6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2c7efe61086181dfd6777bd2c1a2e55e2957d2c5))


PN34 is the active env-opt-in covering the workspace-lock today. P98 is
the forward-compat enable — currently auto-skips on v0.20 due to the
UNIFORM_SINGLE_TOKEN_DECODE drift-marker false-positive (tracked in
docs/UPSTREAM.md, side-noted to Sander on genesis-vllm-patches#9), but
will fire once the marker fix lands.

This matches the pattern long-text.yml and long-text-no-mtp.yml already
use. vllm/default was the only TQ3 compose missing both.

- **vllm/default: add GENESIS_ENABLE_PN34_WORKSPACE_LOCK_RELAX=1 (#82)** ([3167497](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3167497fef643267e42df7009272bb6c062c13fe))


Per @NHClimber87 in #82: cold-boot first decode crashes with
AssertionError: Workspace is locked at turboquant_attn.py:_decode_attention.
Our own docs/CLIFFS.md row "PN34" explicitly says this env flag is required;
the compose just hadn't picked it up.

Other TQ3-using composes (bounded-thinking, dual-turbo, long-vision,
long-text, long-text-no-mtp) have P98 covering the same surface — vllm/default
was the only TQ3 compose missing both. Audit confirmed all fp8 / dflash
composes use a different codepath and don't need this flag.

- **add dual-nvlink-turbo variant (rebased on v7.72.2 master, sibling-table edits dropped) (#65)** ([#65](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/65) by @noonghunna)


Adds docker-compose.dual-nvlink-turbo.yml: NVLink + TurboQuant KV (TQ3) +
MTP n=3 + 4-stream + 262K. Mirrors current dual-turbo.yml (post-#59) with
the three NVLink-specific deltas applied:

  - NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=NVL (vs NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 on PCIe)
  - PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF without expandable_segments (JusefPol crash repro)
  - --disable-custom-all-reduce removed (NVLink P2P → custom kernel wins)

Image pin matches master (nightly-01d4d1ad3); retired sidecars
(patch_workspace_lock_disable, patch_tolist_cudagraph) excluded — superseded
by Genesis v7.72.2 PN34 + P78 natives.

Bench (danbedford rig): 101.49 narr / 133.20 code wall TPS, 20.4 GB/card.
+12.6% narr / +10.7% code over own PCIe-only dual-turbo baseline.
A/B tested on the same rig. Bench was on v7.69 — re-bench welcomed on
the v7.72.2 pin this compose ships with.

Wired into scripts/switch.sh + scripts/launch.sh as
`vllm/dual-nvlink-turbo` on port 8017. Added BENCHMARKS row + updated
UPSTREAM tracker (Marlin pad PR row) to list the new compose.

Sibling-table standardization across the 7 other compose files dropped
per the original author's comment — that's better filed as a separate
issue scoped to the table format.

- **release(v7.72.2-uplift): Genesis pin + vLLM pin + sidecar consolidation (#59)** ([#59](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/59) by @noonghunna)


Aligns club-3090 with Sandermage's Genesis v7.72.2 release (2026-05-05)
which shipped 7 new patches (PN59-PN67), v7.72.1 P68 xgrammar-incompat
auto-skip, and v7.72.2 PN70 schema-subset filter.

Pin bumps:
- scripts/setup.sh GENESIS_PIN: 2db18df (v7.69) → 7b9fd319 (v7.72.2)
- All 16 composes vLLM image: nightly-7a1eb8ac2 → nightly-01d4d1ad3
  (Sander's PROD-validated pin, Genesis allowlist entry #2)

6 local sidecars deleted (Genesis natives supersede):
- patch_inputs_embeds_optional.py → PN35 (vllm#35975 backport)
- patch_pn30_dst_shaped_temp_fix.py → PN30 v7.68
- patch_pn25_genesis_register_fix.py → PN25
- patch_tolist_cudagraph.py → P78 (Sander's v7.72 CHANGELOG retires this)
- patch_workspace_lock_disable.py → PN34
- patch_pr40798_workspace.py → research artifact, no compose mounted it

7 Genesis-loaded composes (yml, dual-turbo, long-text, long-text-no-mtp,
long-vision, bounded-thinking, tools-text) had volume mounts and entry-
point shell invocations cleaned up; GENESIS_ENABLE_PN59_STREAMING_GDN=1
added to all 7 for consistency.

dual.yml left intentionally Genesis-free as a debugging fallback for
cross-engine bisect — useful when isolating "is this Genesis or
upstream vLLM" during silent-empty / OOM triage.

Bench (dual-turbo, 2× 3090, single-stream, 5 measured runs each):
- Narrative wall TPS: 81.21 (CV 2.3%), AL 3.46
- Code wall TPS: 108.20 (CV 0.9%)
- VRAM/card: 20.0 GB (-2.1 GB vs v7.69 baseline of 22.1)
- All 8/8 verify-full checks pass
- verify-stress 6/7 (probe 7 = known TQ3 borderline at 60K, container
  alive throughout — not a regression)

Cross-rig finding filed as Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#22 — PN59
streaming-GDN doesn't engage on chunked-prefill on Ampere consumer:
its eligibility check rejects calls with chunk_indices/chunk_offsets
populated, which vLLM's mandatory --max-num-batched-tokens 4128 always
sets on 24 GB single-card configs. PN59 falls back to _vanilla_path
which OOMs at the same chunk_o.py:161 site PN59 was meant to eliminate.
Single-card 24 GB Cliff 2b is therefore unchanged — workaround is
dual.yml/dual-turbo.yml (TP=2) or llamacpp/default. Docs warnings
placed across README, docs/CLIFFS, docs/HARDWARE, docs/SINGLE_CARD,
docs/FAQ, docs/UPSTREAM, BENCHMARKS, and the 3 affected single-card
compose YAMLs.

v7.72.1 closes #57 (lex's xgrammar-patternProperties fire on long-prompt
agentic IDE traffic).

- **carnice-bf16mtp: restore original template + qwen3_xml parser** ([d57579c](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/d57579c31ae6b4a42d0bf604e0e86364a2e94b85))


- Restored original Carnice chat template (with empty think block)
- Using --tool-call-parser qwen3_xml (original XML format)
- Using --reasoning-parser qwen3 (thinking extraction)

Note: Carnice's tool-call output is inherently unreliable. The model
produces inconsistent XML formats across runs (space vs angle-bracket
parameter delimiters). No vLLM parser handles it reliably. Consider
this compose experimental for tool calls; narrative-only works.

- **carnice-bf16mtp: JSON tool format + empty think block, no reasoning parser** ([a350df7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/a350df7c911b8c8935980e328a7b4c57f374c70b))


Chat template now:
- JSON tool format inside <tool_call> tags (compatible with --tool-call-parser hermes)
- Empty <think></think> block in generation prompt (suppresses thinking)
- No --reasoning-parser (Carnice doesn't use Qwen3 <thought>/<answer> format)

Known limitation: Carnice outputs escaped quotes in JSON arguments string.
The hermes parser handles this correctly with tool_choice: auto + system prompt.

- **carnice-bf16mtp: add HF model URL to header** ([5da50ec](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/5da50ec8978d64ebcefbf11637921955a6edd0e7))
- **carnice-bf16mtp: formal narrative + code bench results** ([7fef94f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7fef94f600a906687d60f4c4a9da85e3659d9da7))


Narrative: 71.75 wall TPS (n=5, CV 11.6%), Code: 80.35 (n=5, CV 10.6%)
MTP AL 3.02-3.14, TTFT ~141ms, 22,246 MiB/card

- **carnice-bf16mtp: 2 streams at 262K confirmed + formal bench numbers** ([66d42c7](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/66d42c7940cacd011ad2468fcb1320f5384766c0))


max-num-seqs=2 boots cleanly at 22,246 MiB/card (same as 1 stream).
Code bench (n=5): 75.6 mean wall TPS, MTP AL 3.15-3.39, TTFT 139ms.
Narrative TPS left as '—' pending formal narrative bench.

- **carnice-bf16mtp: 65K context was config choice, not VRAM ceiling — bumped to 262K** ([1cf0cb2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1cf0cb288e046af486f3ace1ef2295f4944989b2))
- **Carnice-V2-27B + BF16 MTP overlay — new compose variant** ([bc28542](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/bc28542c5571c929ecee3e6371f30457855e9618))


Adds `docker-compose.carnice-bf16mtp.yml` — Hermes agentic fine-tune
of Qwen3.6-27B with MTP spec-decode at ~95% narr / ~91% code TPS of
the base-Qwen dual.yml baseline.

Key findings from the diagnostic push (2026-05-04):
- Root cause diagnosed: Hypothesis B (MTP quant-grid mismatch) = ~70%
  of the AL gap. Un-quantizing 7 mtp.layers.0.* projections (BF16 overlay)
  recovered AL from 2.0 to 3.0.
- Tool-call fix: Carnice's Hermes-style chat template uses XML tool-call
  format, but vLLM's tool-call-parser hermes expects JSON. Patched chat
  template instructs model to output JSON inside tool_call tags.
- Chat template: vendored as patches/carnice-chat-template.jinja and
  mounted RO into the container.

Validated:
  verify-full: 7/8 PASS (thinking test lenient — Carnice is concise)
  verify-stress: 6/7 PASS (needle recall at >=60K — model-level GDN ceiling)
  soak (8x3 turns): PASS — 0 MiB growth, 0 errors, 101.6% TPS retention

Benchmarked at 65.5 narr / 80.9 code wall TPS, 22.25 GB/card VRAM.

- **extend PN25 v3 + PN30 dst-shaped temp fix to all 4 TQ3 composes** ([b875624](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b875624f2d9ea41d6ead3a8563f9ef37ffbdb59c))


PR #23 + PR a62ad78 + PR 9af1a52 shipped PN25 v3 + PN30 dst-shaped temp
fix on long-text only. This commit extends the same patch stack to the
remaining 3 TQ3 composes (long-vision, bounded-thinking, dual-turbo) and
validates each independently.

What changed
------------

- **long-vision.yml**: 198K + 0.98 → **145K + 0.95** + DS layout +
  PN25 v3 + PN30. Vision tower residence forces deeper backoff than
  long-text (engine pre-check returned `estimated max 148608` at 175K +
  0.95, settled at 145K with safety margin).
- **bounded-thinking.yml**: 214K + 0.985 → **180K + 0.95** + DS layout +
  PN25 v3 + PN30. Parity with long-text — same patch stack, same backoff,
  structured-CoT grammar still works on top.
- **dual-turbo.yml**: 262K context preserved + DS layout + PN25 v3 + PN30.
  TP=2 splits state across both cards, fits the patch stack at 0.85
  mem-util cleanly.

Validation per compose (verify-stress.sh, 7 probes)
---------------------------------------------------

| Variant            | Pass count | Failure              |
|--------------------|------------|----------------------|
| long-text          | 6 / 7      | Cliff 2 architectural |
| long-vision        | 6 / 7      | Cliff 2 architectural |
| bounded-thinking   | 6 / 7      | Cliff 2 architectural |
| dual-turbo (TP=2)  | 6 / 7      | Cliff 2 architectural |

All non-architectural probes pass — IDE-agent one-shot, multi-turn agent,
LCB-coding, reasoning-heavy, 25K tool RETURN, small-rung longctx. Cliff 2
(60K+ single prompt DeltaNet GDN forward state OOM) fails on every
variant including TP=2 because GDN state is per-rank not split — that's
fundamental, not addressable on this config class.

Per-config summaries written to:
- results/v0.20-migration/long-vision-pn30.summary
- results/v0.20-migration/bounded-thinking-pn30.summary
- results/v0.20-migration/dual-turbo-pn30.summary

Docs partial update (SINGLE_CARD.md): updated TL;DR table with new ctx
ceilings and removed the Cliff 1 mech B "limitation to know" since both
mechanisms (PN12 eager + PN25 v3 compile) now close it. Kept Cliff 2 as

- **Genesis pin d89a089 → 753344b + cross-rig validation of Sander's PN30/PN31** ([2b5ab4d](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2b5ab4d0cf761e895772290ecaf45573727a0553))


Bumps GENESIS_PIN to Sander's latest dev tip (`753344b`), which contains
his fixes for the 3 issues we filed today:

- d92bcb3 — PN25 worker-fork registration (#16)
- a9977d8 — PN30 DS conv state + spec-decode AL>1 (#17)
- 753344b — PN31 FA varlen persistent out buffer (#15)

Cross-rig validation findings on 1×3090 TP=1
--------------------------------------------

**Sander's d92bcb3 PN25 fix does NOT work on TP=1.** His `hasattr(torch.ops.
genesis, ...)` global-registry guard relies on C++ state surviving spawn,
which empirically does NOT happen on our config (whereas it apparently
does on his TP=2 PROD). Same `infer_schema` crash trace as before.

→ Keeping our local v3 patch (`patch_pn25_genesis_register_fix.py`) which
  takes a different approach: register at activation.py import time as a
  module-level cached global, before any dynamo trace. This works on TP=1.
  Reported back on Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#16.

**PN31 (FA varlen persistent `out` buffer) doesn't fit on 24 GB.** Per-shape
persistent buffers grow as new prompt shapes appear during prefill. Combined
with PN12+PN25's FFN intermediate pool residence, the 24 GB activation
budget runs out at DeltaNet `chunk_fwd_o` (50 MiB needed at 30K depth).
Sander explicitly warned in 753344b he couldn't validate on 24 GB.

→ Disabled in compose. Use tools-text.yml (fp8 path) for 25K+ tool-RETURN
  workloads. Reported back on Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#15.

**PN30 (DS conv state + spec-decode AL>1) introduces a regression on
multi-turn agent shapes.** With PN30 enabled, multi-turn agent prompts
crash with a CUDA device-side assert in `triton_turboquant_store.py:425`
(`v_flat = value.float().reshape(NH, D)`). Sander warned PN30 needed
cross-rig validation because his PROD doesn't exercise the offset>0 path;
this is the regression he asked us to surface.

→ Disabled in compose. Reported back on Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#17.

What works on long-text 180K + 0.95 + PN25 v3 (no PN30, no PN31)

| 4  Multi-turn agent         | ⚠️     | DS conv state — flaky on probe seq |
| 5  LCB-coding               | ❌      | DS conv state (Sander #17 unfixed) |
| 6  Reasoning-heavy 8192     | ✅      | pure reasoning works clean         |

Probes 1.3 + 5 are pre-tracked. Probe 4 is non-deterministic — passes
on fresh-boot single-request but crashes when run in sequence after
probes 1+2+3 (DS conv state path activation may depend on engine state).
Sander #17 still tracks the DS conv state class.

Changes in this commit
----------------------

- `scripts/setup.sh`: GENESIS_PIN d89a089 → 753344b. Re-added PN25 v3
  patch invocation (Sander's d92bcb3 doesn't transfer to TP=1).
- `docker-compose.long-text.yml`: PN30 + PN31 explicitly disabled with
  cross-rig regression notes. mem-util kept at 0.95 (validated config).

- **cliffs: v0.20 unblock recipe + 50K-stress-PASSES finding** ([9506561](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9506561ba8fdc35ef515a17275a2c94a5bec1e69))


Updated "vLLM pin compatibility status" with the empirical unblock:
1. Sandermage's P98 auto-skips on v0.20 (drift marker false-positive).
2. Local patch_workspace_lock_disable.py sidecar relaxes the strict
   assertion to a one-shot WARNING.
3. With the sidecar + Genesis v7.64 + compile-safe sidecar:
   verify-full 8/8, 33K-token stress PASS, 50K-token stress PASS.

The 50K-stress-PASS is the big signal — that cliff fires on EVERY dev205
config (long-text trips line 903; long-vision trips line 909→394→300).
Suggests v0.20 implicitly resolves Genesis #14 (P38 silent no-op) and
#15 (FA varlen workspace) for our configs, possibly via vllm#40092's
TQ FA3/FA4 prefill paths changing the workspace allocator behavior.

Cross-validation across long-vision + bounded-thinking + dual variants
needed before considering a master pin bump from dev205.

- **cliffs: document P38 silently no-op'd on TurboQuant KV path** ([91355b8](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/91355b8fd577fc172f3f6d2af035d06b5ce08ec7))


Instrumented _genesis_continuation_prefill with a call counter (later
reverted) and ran the 33K-token tool-prefill stress on long-text 185K
+ 0.975 + TQ3 KV. The patched body never executed despite dispatcher
reporting "rebound" at boot. Live turboquant_attn.py:903 in the running
container is still the original torch.cat site.

Same architectural class as PN12 forward_native: vLLM's
aot_compile_fullgraph captures the call chain at compile time, baking
in the original method body; class-attribute rebind doesn't update the
compiled artifact. Sandermage's PROD configs use fp8 KV (not
TurboQuant) so the call site never fires there and the silent no-op
isn't visible. Our TQ3-KV configs surface it.

Practical impact on shipped configs: zero — 33K stress passes anyway
(the line 903 cliff fires only at ~50K-token single-shot prefills).
But P38's persistent K_full/V_full reservation (~700 MiB on 27B at
185K) is currently dead memory until either Genesis converts P38 to
the torch.library.custom_op pattern (mirroring what PN25 does for
forward_native) or the underlying compile-time capture changes.

- **long-text/long-vision/bounded-thinking: middle-ground recovery 130K → 175K / 120K → 140K** ([383b5cc](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/383b5cc38197d2ffa68a001c1e0c4c60877d99fe))


After d803278 (130K + 0.95 / 120K + 0.94) shipped, audit surfaced that the
backoff was driven by a synthetic 200K-char (50K-token) single-shot stress
that's heavier than typical agent workloads (ampersandru's repro was ~30K
real tokens; VolandBerlioz's was similar). Realistic agent workloads stay
in the 130K-char (33K-token) class which both 130K + 0.95 and 175K + 0.97
pass.

Recovery: middle-ground configs that keep ~360-720 MiB activation headroom
over the original 0.985 / 0.98 mem-util but recover meaningful context.

  long-text:        130K + 0.95 → 175K + 0.97   verify-full 8/8 (AL 2.87),
                                                 130K-char stress PASS
  bounded-thinking: 130K + 0.95 → 175K + 0.97   parity with long-text
                                                 (verified earlier in #134)
  long-vision:      120K + 0.94 → 140K + 0.95   verify-full 8/8 (AL 2.49),
                                                 130K-char stress PASS
                                                 (intermediate 160K + 0.96
                                                 booted but failed 130K
                                                 stress on vision tower
                                                 overhead; 150K + 0.95
                                                 wouldn't boot — engine
                                                 ceiling at 0.95 vision
                                                 is 140352)

200K-char (50K-token) single-shot synthetic stress still cliffs on all
three — that's the FA varlen workspace allocation we can't reach. The bar
that matters for real users (verify-full + 130K-char stress) is met.

Docs updated: SINGLE_CARD.md picker table + activation-budget rationale +
per-variant blurbs; engines/VLLM.md TL;DR + KV cache table; engines/

- **long-text/long-vision: enable P37 + back off context for activation headroom** ([1a931b4](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1a931b4042090f182266aa150fa0e31d15afdbd5))


P37/P38 test on long-text 205K + 0.985 confirmed Sandermage's design:
P38 closes the torch.cat peak at turboquant_attn.py:903 (ampersandru's
mech B trace). But the cliff moves downstream — at 200K-char (~50K-token)
tool prefills, OOM hits the FA varlen kernel workspace at line 909 → :394
→ flash_attn_interface.py:300. None of our patches reach that allocator
site; PN17 only covers flash_attn.py and our P104 only covers the TQ
wrapper, neither reaches the kernel-internal 50 MiB workspace.

Mamba cache align mode forbids dropping max_num_batched_tokens below the
attention block_size (4128 on this model + TQ3), so chunk-size can't be
the lever. Falling back to context + mem-util reduction:

  long-text:   205K + 0.985 → 130K + 0.95
  long-vision: 198K + 0.98  → 120K + 0.94

Both gain ~1.5 GiB activation headroom. Validation:

  long-text 130K + 0.95   verify-full 8/8 (MTP AL 3.22), verify-stress
                           200K-char tool-prefill PASSES.
  long-vision 120K + 0.94  verify-full 8/8 (MTP AL 3.09), verify-stress
                           130K-char tool-prefill PASSES (200K still
                           cliffs — vision tower's persistent overhead
                           leaves less margin than text-only).

Patch additions (both composes):
- GENESIS_ENABLE_P37=1 — activates the buffer-manager mode P38 expects
  in shared workspace mode. P38 itself auto-applies on platform-eligible
  boots; the env flag is the documented PROD pattern from Sandermage.
- GENESIS_ENABLE_PN17_FA2_LSE_CLAMP=1 (long-vision; long-text already had it).
- GENESIS_ENABLE_FA_MAX_SEQLEN_CLAMP=1 re-enabled on long-text (was
  disabled when PN17 shipped; turns out PN17 doesn't cover the TQ wrapper
  layer, P104 still load-bearing there).
- patch_pn12_compile_safe_custom_op.py mounted + applied on long-vision
  for parity with long-text.

Re-push toward 200K context once upstream FA adds varlen workspace
clamping or Sandermage's next pin extends PN17 coverage to the kernel
entry point.

- **genesis: bump pin v7.62 → v7.64 + add compile-safe FFN sidecar (#16)** ([53d0663](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/53d0663a50c91f0a929917ae6390303842508e9e))


Setup script: pin updated 917519b → 64dd18b. Verified clean on tools-text
(75K + fp8 KV + MTP, PN8 enabled): verify-full.sh 8/8 + verify-stress.sh
tool-prefill OK. v7.64 release notes adopted: PN17 is Sandermage's anchored
version of our P104 sidecar (FA2 softmax_lse runtime clamp), PN19 sets
max_split_size_mb=20 during model load.

long-text.yml (218K + 0.985 + TQ3 + MTP):
- Genesis pin v7.64 (PN17 enabled, PN19 disabled — costs ~120 MiB KV pool
  on Ampere consumer; the documented "200-500 MiB win on H100" is negative
  on our hardware).
- Drops max-model-len 218000 → 205000 because PN17 reserves ~120 MiB of KV
  pool space at boot ("estimated maximum model length is 206400" is the
  engine pre-check failure mode otherwise).
- P104 sidecar (patch_fa_max_seqlen_clamp.py) kept mounted but env-disabled;
  PN17 covers the same path via Sandermage's anchored fix. Flip the env
  var back on if PN17 turns out not to cover turboquant_attn.py for some
  config.
- Mounts new patch_pn12_compile_safe_custom_op.py — opaque torch.library
  custom_op for the inductor-compiled forward_native FFN path that the
  eager-mode forward_cuda sidecar can't reach (issue #16, mech B). Only
  active when GENESIS_ENABLE_PN12_FFN_INTERMEDIATE_POOL=1; harmless when
  off. Forward_native body simplified to a single static-guard branch on
  module-level _PN12_ENABLED so Dynamo specializes at trace time instead
  of compiling both branches (the else-branch's plain F.silu/mul lowers
  to empty_strided_cuda, defeating the patch).

verify-stress.sh: fixed silent false-positive where check_tool_prefill
returned 0 even after fail() because rm -f cleanup clobbered $? — now
captures rc before cleanup and propagates.

CLIFFS.md: cross-reference Sandermage's broader 8-cliff catalog and add
"vLLM pin compatibility status" section documenting the v0.20 workspace-
lock regression (PR #39226) that blocks our config and is unrelated to
Cliff 1/2.

- **Add local FA max seqlen clamp sidecar** ([9f06a0f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/9f06a0fe79e8e4f55b438c2e2427b8738e72d1cf))
- **Fix local PN12 activation pool anchor** ([41eabac](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/41eabac17b0b8b558121e213be1498855be314d6))
- **CLIFFS: document PN12-is-partial finding (full stack still hits wall)** ([537875a](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/537875a7fd1235ef21006ef1c5f5c2d5aabee74a))


Tested PN12 + PN13 + P101(anchor-fixed) + P103 + P104 + 50-block-override
on long-text 205K + 0.98 + TQ3 + no-vision. Result: Cliff 1 STILL
fires at 138 MiB / 130 MiB free, same FFN buffer signature.

PN12 only pools SiluAndMul.forward_cuda output (step 3 of FFN forward).
The OOM site is gate_proj or up_proj output (steps 1/2), each shape
[max_num_batched_tokens, intermediate_size] = 138 MiB, fresh-allocated
per layer per step. PN12 cuts allocator churn from 4× per layer to 3×;
significant but insufficient.

Holding off on commenting at issue #11 while Sandermage is actively
shipping. Will share data when he resurfaces. Local Genesis branches
(P101 anchor fix, P104) ready when needed.

Filed Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#11 asking whether a Genesis-
style text-patch clamping attn_metadata.max_seq_len at the FA call
site (in the prefill, non-capture path) is feasible. If yes, would
structurally close Cliff 1 on TQ3 paths instead of relying on PN8's
absorb-the-leak strategy.

User couldn't see context size for each option without reading the
"Why" column or per-config subsections. Now first-class:

- SINGLE_CARD TL;DR: Max ctx column (75K / 48K / 192K / 205K / 262K)
- DUAL_CARD TL;DR: Max ctx column (262K / 262K / 185K / 200K), plus
  the verified-237K-single-prompt note on dual.yml

The perf chart was at line 151 in a bottom "Performance summary"
section; SINGLE_CARD has it at line 24 right after the TL;DR. New
visitors landed at the dual page expecting the same shape. Moved
the dual perf chart up to mirror SINGLE_CARD's structure
(TL;DR → perf → VRAM → pick), removed the duplicate at the bottom.

P68 (auto force tool_choice=required) and P69 (inject "must use a
tool" reminder) silently fired on prompts > 8000 chars — every IDE
agent (Cline, Cursor, OpenCode, Copilot Gateway) blew past that
threshold instantly and got silent finish_reason=stop with no
content + no tool_calls on greetings or clarifying questions.

Bisection on club-3090#2 (HoodOG1 + tenitram):
  state A (P64+P68+P69+PN8): broken
  state B (P64+P69+PN8, P68 off): still broken — model loops on
    "I cannot respond with plain text" then stops mid-reasoning
  state D (P64+PN8, P68+P69 off): clean — greeting → plain-text
    reply; tool request → clean read_file call

P64 (qwen3coder MTP streaming early-return fix) and PN8 (FP8+MTP

  launch.sh adds --no-preflight escape hatch.
- launch.sh wizard inverted: cards → workload → auto-pick engine.
  Newcomers can answer "how many GPUs" and "what do I want to do" but
  rarely "vLLM or llama.cpp" — engine falls out of the pick with a
  one-paragraph why. --engine override still works (filters the
  workload list to that engine).

Documents the two compatibility issues users will hit with VS Code's
Copilot LLM Gateway:

1. Tool-schema preamble is ~20K tokens — fast-chat.yml's 20K cap is
   too small. Recommended pick is tools-text.yml (75K + fp8 + PN8,
   Cliff 1 closed since Genesis v7.62.x).

2. Copilot probe-style requests with max_tokens=64 truncate tool-call
   JSON mid-string. With tool_choice: required + minItems: 1 in their
   structured-outputs schema, the model must emit a tool call that
   takes real arguments — won't fit in 64 tokens. Manifests as
   "empty response" client-side. Server-side correct.

- **Add CONTRIBUTING.md — what kind of PRs land cleanly** ([0c261eb](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/0c261ebcdfaf8bd057195d007eee28dfc5922085))


Three sections:

1. What's welcome — bench numbers from new rigs, bug reports with
   the data we always need, upstream-bug minimum repros, new compose
   variants with verify-full + verify-stress + bench output, new
   model support (with the canonical learnings/<model>.md template),
   patch experiments (Genesis-style file replacements + idempotent
   patcher), genuine doc clarity wins, cross-link to your published
   numbers (Reddit / blog / Twitter).

2. What's NOT — doc style nitpicks, untested config knobs (every
   flag we ship has a measurement attached), removing the two-routes
   editorial framing without new data, vendoring upstream, marketing-
   style README rewrites, driveby PRs that don't run verify-full.

3. Process for non-trivial PRs — issue first / branch off master /
   verify-full + verify-stress / bench numbers / four-question PR
   description (what / impact / compared-to / trade-off) / upstream
   author attribution.

Closes with the ground rules: don't claim numbers you didn't measure,
always capture VRAM during benchmarks, pin everything, differentiate
"shipped" from "measured."

- **CHANGELOG: capture post-launch polish day in cross + per-model logs** ([1cc6ee6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/1cc6ee6e24f991bed4a63eb084c82bea0a17bf21))


Cross-cutting CHANGELOG.md gets an entry for: launch.sh / switch.sh /
health.sh / EXAMPLES.md / FAQ.md / VRAM diagram / Kaitchup citation /
README two-routes polish.

Per-model models/qwen3.6-27b/CHANGELOG.md gets the model-scoped slice:
Q3_K_XL first-bench (21 TPS, mainline regression flagged), llama.cpp
Docker compose addition (default + concurrent), stress-test sweep
finding (no Cliff 1 / no Cliff 2 on llama.cpp — reframes launch story),
VRAM diagram, Kaitchup quant validation.

No code changes — just dated history capture.

- **Add launch.sh wizard + switch.sh stateless variant switcher** ([4b77ed5](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/4b77ed5eb1eee64bbf913a332f38a54746c17d05))


scripts/switch.sh — stateless engine/variant switcher. Brings down
whatever's running (any vllm-qwen36-27b* or llama-cpp-qwen36-27b*
container — discovers compose file via docker labels), brings up
the new variant, waits for /v1/models to respond. Supports --list
(show all 13 variants) and --down (stop without booting). Variant
names are <engine>/<file-stem>: vllm/default, vllm/dual, vllm/
dual-turbo, vllm/dual-dflash, vllm/dual-dflash-noviz, vllm/long-
vision, vllm/long-text, vllm/fast-chat, vllm/tools-text, vllm/
no-genesis-mtp, vllm/minimal, llamacpp/default, llamacpp/concurrent.

scripts/launch.sh — interactive wizard for first-run users. Asks
engine → cards → workload, maps to variant, calls switch.sh, then
runs verify-full.sh to confirm clean serving. Also accepts flags
for non-interactive use:
  bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/default
  bash scripts/launch.sh --engine vllm --cards 1   (asks the rest)

README.md — quick-start replaces "cd into compose dir + docker
compose up" with `bash scripts/launch.sh`. Click-throughs from the
launch tweet land in a guided flow instead of having to find the
right compose file by hand.

- **Add per-card VRAM allocation diagram + reference from model README** ([88523b3](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/88523b3d05985476ae5bcbaeee05aab4d091319e))


docs/img/vram-budget-dual.svg / .png — stacked horizontal bars showing
per-card VRAM breakdown across 7 configs (3 single-card, 4 dual-card)
on the 24 GB budget. Components: weights / KV cache / vision tower /
DFlash draft / activations+workspace / free headroom.

The dual section makes the TP=2 unlock visually obvious — each card
holds half the weights and half the KV, which is why 262K + vision +
2 streams fits at ~23.6 GB / card on dual but doesn't fit at all on
single-card without dropping context to 48K (Cliff 1 with tools) or
60K (Cliff 2 single-prompt).

Component sizes are approximate (architectural math + boot-log
inspection); per-card totals are measured from this session's
re-bench (see CHANGELOG row table).

Wired into models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md right after the compose-
variants tables and before "What's working" — readers can see the
TPS table and the VRAM diagram side by side.

- **Cite Kaitchup Qwen3.6-27B GGUF eval as quant-quality lens** ([b7ef91f](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/b7ef91f9518d5b8f521d2b850570722322c4ea3b))


Benjamin Marie (@bnjmn_marie) published an H100 quant sweep on
Qwen3.6-27B (Q2_K_XL / IQ3_XXS / Q3_K_XL / IQ2_XXS + abliterated)
and independently picked Q3_K_XL as the best accuracy / token-
efficiency / footprint balance. That's the same quant we ship as the
default in our llama.cpp Docker compose.

Adding a citation block in the quant recommendations table:
- Marks UD-Q3_K_XL row as our default ⭐
- Cross-link to the Kaitchup article (charts + methodology there)
- Frames the split: their eval = quality lens, our bench = speed lens

- **Pin Genesis to exact tested commit + add .env.example + issue templates** ([ec704e4](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/ec704e4e2e86d8ff2ec990d8d544427f3e957dcd))


- setup.sh: GENESIS_PIN now defaults to commit bf667c7 (Genesis HEAD as of
  2026-04-27, semver "v7.54"). This is the exact tree our published TPS
  numbers were measured against; tagged v7.51-stable was one minor older
  but came up first because the SHA isn't durable. Switch to commit pin
  removes the doc-vs-runtime mismatch. Clone strategy adjusted since
  --branch + --depth 1 doesn't accept SHAs.
- .env.example: documents MODEL_DIR / HF_TOKEN / CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES /
  MEM_UTIL / MAX_MODEL_LEN / GENESIS_PIN / SKIP_GENESIS / URL / WARMUPS /
  RUNS with the same defaults the composes ship. Pure opt-in.
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/: bug-report.yml requires docker logs --tail 100,
  verify-full.sh output, nvidia-smi, GPU config, compose variant, repo
  commit. numbers-from-your-rig.yml structures cross-rig TPS contributions
  with rig spec, bench output, VRAM, max ctx, and notes. config.yml
  routes Q&A to Discussions.
- .gitignore: drop trailing slash on genesis pattern so it also ignores
  local symlinks that some of us point at out-of-tree clones.

- **Dual-card re-bench on club-3090 substrate + fix dual-turbo mount path** ([c701474](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/c70147426dd241e894186f40bb3207a53f43c8df))


The published dual-card TPS numbers (T1, DT1, D5, D7 in BENCHMARKS.md)
were measured pre-v714-formalization on a different nightly + Genesis
tree. Re-benched all 4 dual composes today on the unified club-3090
substrate (dev205 + Genesis v7.51-stable + Marlin pad fork mounted).

Also caught + fixed a stale mount path in dual-turbo.yml — predecessor
referenced patch_tolist_cudagraph.py at `../patches/genesis/` (old
qwen36-dual-3090 layout); club-3090 has it at `../patches/` (top-level).
Container died at boot with 'cant find __main__ module' before fix.
Audited all 9 composes — only dual-turbo had the bug.

Re-bench numbers (3 warm + 5 measured per prompt arm):

  Compose                           Narr (CV)      Code (CV)      AL        VRAM/card  vs claimed
  dual.yml                          69.05 (2.3%)   88.58 (3.4%)   3.4       23.6 GB    -3% / -1%
  dual-turbo.yml (now TQ3)          53.65 (2.7%)   72.93 (2.7%)   3.4       24.1 GB    -8% / +6%  vs k8v4
  dual-dflash.yml                   81.94 (4.3%)   124.93 (5.8%)  4.1-4.4   23.6 GB    +5% / -2%
  dual-dflash-noviz.yml             78.19 (2.5%)   126.99 (2.2%)  4.2-4.4   23.8 GB    +2% / +2%

Net: most numbers within run-to-run variance. dual-turbo's TQ3 swap (from
k8v4) cost ~8% narrative but recovered ~6% code — net trade for ~9× the
KV pool capacity (which is what the compose exists for).

verify-full.sh: dual.yml passes 10/10 incl. 90K needle. dual-turbo passes
10/10 too. DFlash variants passed all checks except longctx (skipped for
time; recall path validated previously).

Doc updates:
  - models/qwen3.6-27b/README.md: dual-card variant table updated with
    measured numbers (was 71/89, 58/69, 78/128, 77/124 → 69/89, 54/73,
    82/125, 78/127). Also corrected DFlash variants to FP16 KV (was
    written as fp8 in the table but file uses default FP16).
  - models/qwen3.6-27b/USE_CASES.md: quick map updated with measured
    dual TPS for each workload.
  - dual.yml header: measured-numbers line replaces predecessor's claim;
    variant matrix in dual.yml updated.
  - dual-turbo.yml header: TPS regression vs fp8 noted as ~22% (was
    "~25% trade" claim).
  - CHANGELOG.md: dated entry documenting the re-bench + path fix.

- **dual-turbo: switch kv-cache-dtype k8v4 → 3bit_nc to align with test findings** ([3e1f5f6](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3e1f5f61c0475474461008a71d54ca39ddc908b5))


The predecessor dual-3090 README documented `turboquant_3bit_nc` for the
turbo variant, but the actual compose shipped `turboquant_k8v4` (likely
config drift that was never reconciled). Earlier this session I kept the
file as-is and updated the doc to match — but that was the wrong call.

What our test findings actually say:
- Single-card v714 default ships turboquant_3bit_nc, validated extensively
  (51 narr / 68 code TPS, 10/10 verify-full.sh checks pass)
- Memory entry: "Lorbus Qwen3.6-27B + MTP + TurboQuant = 85 TPS / 125K
  single-card ⭐" — TQ3, the same _3bit_nc preset
- Predecessor dual-3090 README claimed 3bit_nc for turbo too

So 3bit_nc IS the tested config across the project; k8v4 was the drift.
Aligning the dual-turbo file with that. Trade-offs:

- TQ3 is 3 bits/token avg (vs k8v4's ~6 bits/token avg) — smaller KV per
  token → larger KV pool capacity at same mem-util
- The published "4.59× concurrency at 262K" claim should hold at MINIMUM,
  likely improve modestly (more KV pool → more streams or longer tail)
- Per-stream TPS should be roughly similar (KV bandwidth and compute paths
  are similar between the two TurboQuant variants)

Risk: I haven't booted dual-card to confirm. The change is internally
consistent with single-card test data + predecessor docs. Cross-rig users
will validate via verify-full.sh on actual dual hardware.

Updated dual.yml's variant-matrix table accordingly (TQ k8v4 → TQ3).

- **Pin Genesis version + fix MODEL_DIR defaults + clean stale headers** ([7f00e52](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/7f00e5214072491637ba7b02cdec2c9e8135b445))


Three related fixes for the post-restructure layout to actually work:

1. Pin Genesis to a tested tag (addresses walmis #8)
   - setup.sh now does `git clone --branch v7.51-stable-2026-04-27 --depth 1`
     instead of plain `git clone` (= latest HEAD). Re-runs `git checkout`
     on the pinned tag if the dir already exists.
   - GENESIS_PIN env var lets users opt into a different tag/commit.
   - Sanity-check the v7.14 layout (vllm/_genesis package) and bail with
     a clear error if missing, rather than silently shipping a broken
     compose-genesis combination.

2. MODEL_DIR default in all 9 composes (smoke-test fix)
   - Old default was ${MODEL_DIR:-../models}, which from the new compose
     dir at models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/ resolved to a non-existent
     path. Composes silently created an empty mount target → vLLM
     couldn't find the model on first boot.
   - Updated all 9 composes (single + dual variants) to:
     ${MODEL_DIR:-../../../../models-cache}
     This resolves to repo-root/models-cache/ which is exactly where
     setup.sh now downloads. Booting works zero-arg if you ran setup.sh.
   - Users with model weights elsewhere can still set MODEL_DIR via env.
   - Validated: from the new paths,
       MODEL_DIR=/mnt/models/huggingface docker compose up -d
     boots cleanly and verify-full.sh passes all 10 checks.

3. Clean stale header comments
   - tools-text.yml: header still self-described as alternate to old
     "20K default" + referenced deleted longctx-experimental.yml.
     Updated to current variant matrix (default 48K, this 75K text-only).
   - minimal.yml: similar — "20K default" + longctx-experimental refs.
     Updated.
   - fast-chat.yml: already fixed in previous commit.

Smoke test: verify-full.sh from the new club-3090 paths passes 10/10
(including #4 tool calling, #8 tool-response prefill OOM, #10 MTP AL).

- **Fix .gitignore + add the entire models/ tree (initial commit was incomplete)** ([2511a98](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/2511a981109b983d05247a485db8bdf999c6d38e))


The old repos used models/ as the model-weights download directory, so
their .gitignore excluded it. We copied that .gitignore into club-3090
without updating, which silently dropped the entire models/ subtree
from the initial commit on GitHub (everything still on disk locally,
just not tracked).

Fixes:
- .gitignore: remove models/, add models-cache/ (the new default for
  weights download). Update genesis patches path to the new location
  models/<model>/vllm/patches/genesis/. Update compose-state ignores
  to use **/compose/ glob since composes are now nested. Add vllm-src/
  for the dual-card Marlin pad fork mount.
- Add the missing models/qwen3.6-27b/ tree:
  - README.md / INTERNALS.md / USE_CASES.md / CHANGELOG.md
  - vllm/README.md + 9 docker-compose.yml variants + patches dir
  - llama-cpp/README.md + 2 launch recipes
  - sglang/README.md (currently blocked status)

Also fixes: stale comment header in fast-chat.yml that referenced the
deleted longctx-experimental.yml and self-described as "default" when
it's the chat-only variant.

- **Initial commit — club-3090: model-agnostic LLM serving recipes for RTX 3090** ([3fa3333](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/commit/3fa33332ce12b042c171fc98ad21fe412c0f92a0))


Consolidates and supersedes:
  - noonghunna/qwen36-27b-single-3090
  - noonghunna/qwen36-dual-3090

The two predecessor repos partitioned by card count (1× vs 2×). This
repo partitions by engine instead, which matches how users actually
decide ("vLLM or llama.cpp?" before "1 card or 2"). Card count becomes
a config variant within each engine.

Structure (model-agnostic from day 1):

    docker-compose.fast-chat.yml   fp8 + 20K, 55/70 TPS — fastest at small ctx
    docker-compose.tools-text.yml  fp8 + 75K, 53/70 TPS — best for long single prompts
    docker-compose.no-genesis-mtp.yml control variant
    docker-compose.minimal.yml     no spec-decode

  Dual-card:

  single-card-max-ctx.sh    Q4_K_M + q4_0 KV at full 262K — the standout recipe

Old repos remain readable for issue history + external links (Medium,
