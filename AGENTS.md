# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Continue, etc.) working in this repo. Focused — only conventions an agent wouldn't infer from the code itself.

## Read first

Before making non-trivial changes:

- [`README.md`](README.md) — what the repo is, two-routes framing, repo layout
- [`docs/SINGLE_CARD.md`](docs/SINGLE_CARD.md) / [`docs/DUAL_CARD.md`](docs/DUAL_CARD.md) — pick-by-workload guidance + the cliffs they reference
- [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md) — every upstream issue / PR we depend on or have filed (see "Upstream issues" section below for why this matters)
- [`models/qwen3.6-27b/INTERNALS.md`](models/qwen3.6-27b/INTERNALS.md) — DFlash forensics, AutoRound rationale, Marlin pad fork, MTP head
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — what kinds of PRs land cleanly + benchmark + verify protocol

## Hardware truths

- 2× RTX 3090 Ampere SM 8.6, PCIe-only, **no NVLink** (and we won't add it).
- Custom all-reduce must be disabled in vLLM/SGLang configs (PCIe topology breaks NVLink-assumed paths).
- No native FP8 compute; FP8 KV is a storage optimization only.
- Speculative decoding using EAGLE / DFlash is blocked on Qwen3-Next family (DeltaNet rollback). MTP works. See [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md) — vllm#39931.

## Upstream issues — single source of truth

`docs/UPSTREAM.md` tracks every upstream issue / PR we depend on, have filed, or use as context. **Before filing a new upstream issue or referencing an existing one in code/docs, check this file.** When status changes (issue closed, PR merged, pin bumped), update the row.

This rule exists because we previously had upstream links scattered across CHANGELOG, INTERNALS, FAQ, and per-compose comment headers — and they drifted. The tracker file is the canonical place; cross-link to it from anywhere else.

When filing a fresh upstream issue from this work:
1. Add the row to `docs/UPSTREAM.md` first
2. Link the issue back to `noonghunna/club-3090` in the body (helps maintainers see affected user surface)
3. If the upstream eventually merges + propagates, update the row to ✅ Resolved and bump the relevant pin (Genesis commit, vLLM nightly, etc.) in the same commit / PR

## Conventions on this repo

### Bench protocol
3 warm + 5 measured runs. Canonical prompts: 800-word essay (narrative, max_tokens=1000) + quicksort code (max_tokens=800). `temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20`. Capture both wall-time TPS and engine-internal `gen throughput` from logs. **Always capture per-card peak VRAM** alongside TPS.

### Genesis opt-in env vars
Genesis ships ~50 env-gated patches. Some are **targeted bugfixes** (P64 streaming, PN8 memory savings, P3/P5/P6 KV); others are **behavioral mitigations** that silently rewrite the request (P68 = `tool_choice → required`, P69 = inject "must use tool" reminder). Behavioral mitigations need a streaming + large-prompt repro before shipping default-on. We learned this the hard way on 2026-04-29 — see [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md) → Genesis #9 row + the [club-3090 #2 thread](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/2#issuecomment-4346740245).

If you're considering enabling a new Genesis env var by default in a shipped compose:
1. Read the patch's header docstring in `vllm/_genesis/wiring/`. Does it modify `request.tool_choice`, `request.messages`, or rewrite output?
2. If yes (behavioral): run a streaming repro with prompt > the patch's threshold + a casual user message ("hi") + `tool_choice: auto`. If `finish_reason=stop` with empty content, don't ship default-on.
3. Pure bugfixes (no behavioral override) are fine to ship default-on once they pass `verify-full.sh`.

### CHANGELOG
- `CHANGELOG.md` (cross-cutting) and `models/<name>/CHANGELOG.md` (per-model) are **append-only history**. Don't rewrite past entries even when a finding is superseded — add a new entry. The historical trail is load-bearing for "why did we do X."
- Old entries can reference files / patches that no longer exist. That's fine — leave them.

### Compose variants
- Each variant ships with a **header table** comparing it against sibling composes in the same directory. Update both directions when adding/removing variants.
- Keep the variant set lean. Three composes that overlap badly (similar TPS + similar context + same KV) is worse than two with a clean differentiation. Removed `fast-chat.yml` 2026-04-29 for exactly this reason.

#### Compose layout — `<model>/<engine>/compose/<topology>/<feature>.yml`

The directory hierarchy encodes (model, engine, topology); the filename encodes the feature stack. No level repeats information from another.

| Path level | Encodes | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `models/<model>/` | Model | `qwen3.6-27b` · `gemma-4-31b` |
| `models/<model>/<engine>/` | Inference engine | `vllm` · `llama-cpp` · `sglang` |
| `compose/<topology>/` | Hardware topology | `single` · `dual` · `multi3` · `multi4` · `multi8` |
| `<feature>.yml` (filename) | Feature stack | `docker-compose.yml` (recommended default) · `turbo.yml` · `dflash.yml` · `nvlink-dflash-noviz.yml` |

**Topology rule**: `single` (TP=1) and `dual` (TP=2) have no count ambiguity. `multi<N>` requires the count because N varies (3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 8). Aligns with `docs/SINGLE_CARD.md` / `DUAL_CARD.md` / `MULTI_CARD.md` doc framing.

**Default-per-topology rule**: each topology subdirectory has a `docker-compose.yml` — the recommended starter. Bare `cd <topology> && docker compose up` works because docker compose finds `docker-compose.yml` automatically. Variants drop the `docker-compose.` prefix because they're explicitly invoked with `-f`.

**Feature suffix order** (when stacking): interconnect → drafter → KV → vision modifier. Examples:
- `dual/turbo.yml` — TP=2 + TurboQuant KV
- `dual/dflash.yml` — TP=2 + DFlash drafter
- `dual/nvlink-dflash-noviz.yml` — TP=2 + NVLink + DFlash + no vision
- `dual/int8.yml` — TP=2 + INT8 PTH KV
- `dual/awq.yml` — TP=2 + AWQ-4bit weights
- `multi4/dflash.yml` — TP=4 + DFlash

Concrete examples (post-2026-05-09 restructure):
- `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/single/docker-compose.yml` — Qwen single-card default
- `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/single/long-text.yml` — Qwen single-card text-only long-ctx variant
- `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/dual/docker-compose.yml` — Qwen dual default (fp8 + MTP)
- `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/dual/turbo.yml` — Qwen dual + TQ3
- `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/multi4/dflash.yml` — Qwen 4-card + DFlash
- `models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/compose/dual/docker-compose.yml` — Gemma dual default (bf16 + MTP)
- `models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/compose/dual/int8.yml` — Gemma dual + INT8 PTH KV

Filename collisions across topology dirs (e.g. `dual/dflash.yml` vs `multi4/dflash.yml`) are fine — the path disambiguates. Registry tags in `scripts/switch.sh` decouple from filesystem paths; rename only the file path in the VARIANTS map and keep tags backward-compatible.

**Fine-tune exception**: model-specific fine-tunes that share the canonical model's compose directory keep the fine-tune name as a filename prefix (e.g. `dual/carnice-bf16mtp.yml`, `dual/qwopus-bf16mtp.yml` under `models/qwen3.6-27b/`). Long-term those fine-tunes can graduate to their own model directories (`models/carnice-v2-27b/`, `models/qwopus3.6-27b/`) when their variant set warrants it.

#### Patches and caches stay engine-level (NOT under a topology)

`<model>/<engine>/patches/` and `<model>/<engine>/cache/` sit parallel to `compose/`, not under any topology subdirectory. Three reasons:

1. **Patches are reused across topologies.** `vllm-marlin-pad/` is mounted by `dual/docker-compose.yml`, `multi4/docker-compose.yml`, and every `dual/nvlink-*.yml`. Putting it under one topology dir would force the others to symlink or duplicate.
2. **Patches are scoped by (model, engine), not by topology.** A vLLM source override doesn't change based on TP=1 vs TP=4; it's an in-container engine-internal patch that applies the same way regardless of mount layout.
3. **Caches (`torch_compile/`, `triton/`) warm-start across composes.** Sharing them at the engine level means switching from `single/docker-compose.yml` to `single/long-text.yml` reuses the JIT'd kernels instead of recompiling.

Relative paths from a compose to its sibling patches/caches: `../../patches/...` and `../../cache/...` (one `..` from `<topology>/` up to `compose/`, second `..` up to the engine dir, then `patches/` or `cache/`). All 27 shipped composes follow this.

**If a future patch is genuinely topology-specific** (e.g., a kernel rewrite that only applies to TP=2), keep it at `<engine>/patches/<patch-name>/` and document the topology constraint in the patch's README. Discoverability ("one `patches/` per engine, search there") trumps the marginal benefit of a topology partition.

#### Profile schema header (every compose, every time)

Every compose starts with a `Profile (at-a-glance)` block declaring the (Model, Topology, Drafter, KV, Vision, Max-ctx, Genesis) tuple in structured form. Free-form description follows below the schema, not in place of it.

```yaml
# ===========================================================================
# Profile (at-a-glance):
#   Model:     <name + quant — e.g. "Qwen3.6-27B (Lorbus AutoRound INT4)">
#   Topology:  <e.g. "Dual 3090 PCIe (TP=2, no NVLink)">
#   Drafter:   <none | MTP n=N | DFlash n=N | ngram K=N>
#   KV:        <fp8_e5m2 | bf16 | int8_per_token_head | turboquant_3bit_nc>
#   Vision:    <yes | no>
#   Max ctx:   <e.g. 262K>
#   Genesis:   <none | v7.72.2 | N/A — Genesis is Qwen3-Next-specific>
#   Status:    <optional — only if not production: ⚠️ PREVIEW / BOOT-OOM / etc.>
#   Best for:  <one short phrase — what workload this serves; ⭐ for canonical>
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (existing free-form description continues below)
```

This rule applies to **shipped composes AND local-only test composes** — apply the convention even before deciding whether to ship; it avoids a rename later if the experiment graduates.

When testing a new model, create the directory hierarchy from the start: `models/<new-model>/<engine>/compose/<topology>/docker-compose.yml`. The hierarchy enforces the convention; filenames encode only the feature stack within that topology. When the model isn't Qwen3-Next, write `Genesis: N/A — Genesis is Qwen3-Next-specific` in the profile schema so readers don't expect Genesis-style perf folds where they don't apply.

#### Where do experimental / unvalidated composes live?

**Same directory as shipped composes, but kept untracked until validation passes.** Don't create a separate `experimental/` subdirectory — the relative paths to `../patches/...` and `../cache/...` are calibrated to the compose dir, and promoting an experiment from a sub-folder would require re-pathing every mount.

Workflow:

1. **Author the compose** in `models/<model>/<engine>/compose/<topology>/<feature>.yml` (or `docker-compose.yml` for the topology default) with the standard profile schema header. Mark `Status: ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL` (or `⚠️ PREVIEW` if quality issues are known) so readers know it's not validated.
2. **Don't `git add`** until validation passes. The file shows up in `git status` as `??` — that's the signal. `git ls-tree -r HEAD` lists only shipped composes; the gap between that and `ls compose/*.yml` tells you what's pending validation.
3. **Validation gates** before promoting: `verify-full.sh` 8/8, `verify-stress.sh` 7/7 (or documented failures with rationale), `bench.sh` (numbers added to BENCHMARKS.md), `soak-test.sh SOAK_MODE=continuous` (catches Cliff 2b).
4. **Promote**: drop the `Status: ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL` line from the profile schema, `git add`, commit. Cross-rig validation can come later via the `numbers-from-your-rig` issue template.

For **entirely new models** under validation (e.g. "let's try MiniMax-M2.7"): keep the whole `models/<new-model>/` directory untracked until at least one compose validates. Avoid pushing `models/<new-model>/README.md` etc. before there's a working compose to back it up — empty model directories on master signal capability we don't actually have.

### Documentation
- Don't create new docs proactively. Most non-obvious things belong in `INTERNALS.md`, `FAQ.md`, `SINGLE_CARD.md`, or `DUAL_CARD.md`. New top-level files only when there's a recurring search miss.
- Charts: source `.svg` + exported `.png` at retina resolution (≥1500px wide). Markdown embeds use `.png` (clicking opens a viewable image; SVG opens raw XML). Re-generate with `python3 tools/charts/gen-perf.py` and `gen-vram.py` after editing data.
- For any change that adds a footnote to "this depends on upstream X" — the answer is to link the row in `docs/UPSTREAM.md`, not to inline-cite the upstream URL.

### Tests
- `verify-full.sh` — fast functional smoke (~1–2 min). Runs on every compose change.
- `verify-stress.sh` — boundary cases (longctx ladder + tool-prefill OOM ~5–10 min). Runs on cliff-related changes.
- `bench.sh` — canonical TPS bench. Run when you change anything that could move TPS (compose flags, Genesis env vars, vLLM pin).

### Commits
- New commit per logical change. Don't amend published commits.
- Commit messages: subject ≤72 chars, imperative ("Disable P68/P69..." not "Disabled..."), optional body for "why."
- Don't push without local verify-full + verify-stress passing for the affected compose.

### Hooks / verification
- Pre-flight checks live in `scripts/preflight.sh` and run from `setup.sh` + `launch.sh`. They check docker / GPU / disk before any heavy work. If a check fails, print an actionable `Fix:` hint, never a cryptic mid-run crash.

## Things to NOT do

- Don't add NVLink suggestions. The user has explicitly declined.
- Don't recommend EAGLE / DFlash spec-decode on Qwen3-Next single-card. It's blocked by DeltaNet rollback (see [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md) → vllm#39931). MTP works.
- Don't enable Genesis behavioral patches (P68/P69 class) by default. They override user intent. If a user wants them, they can flip the env var.
- Don't claim a TPS number you didn't measure. "Should be ~80" labeled as estimate is fine; "is 80" needs a bench.
- Don't compress historical CHANGELOG entries. Append-only.
- Don't scatter upstream issue links across multiple docs. Link to the row in `docs/UPSTREAM.md` instead.
