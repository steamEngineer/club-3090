## Hardware

### Can I use a 4090 instead of a 3090?

Yes — 4090 (Ada, sm_89) is strictly better than 3090 (Ampere, sm_86) for everything we ship. Slightly different kernel paths but no patches needed. Caveats: vLLM Genesis patches are tested on Ampere; tools should still work but TPS scaling is untested. Open an issue with numbers if you bench it.

### Can I use a 5090?

Should work for vLLM (Blackwell adds new kernels but back-compat). The Marlin pad-sub-tile-n fork we mount targets Ampere edge cases — on Blackwell you can probably drop the `/opt/ai/engines/vllm/primary/` mount. Not validated yet. We'd love numbers from a 5090 rig — use the [Numbers from your rig](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/new?template=numbers-from-your-rig.yml) issue template.

### Do I need NVLink?

No. Our dual-card configs use PCIe-only, no NVLink. Custom all-reduce is disabled in the composes. NVLink would help dual-card TPS but it's not required, and the user has explicitly declined NVLink bridges as a default — adding the dependency would exclude most consumer rigs.

### What dtype/quant should I pick for my GPU?

Depends on the arch. The short version:

- **Ampere (3090/A100, sm_80/86)** → AutoRound INT4 weights + TQ3 / INT8 PTH / fp8 KV (fp8 KV works but is software-emulated). The primary target of this stack.
- **Ada (4090/L40, sm_89)** → same as Ampere + you get a real FP8 hardware path for KV.
- **Hopper (H100, sm_90)** → FP8 weights + FP8 KV on the transformer engine.
- **Blackwell consumer (5090, sm_120)** → AutoRound INT4 today; NVFP4 / MXFP* when the kernels mature.
- **Pre-Turing (V100, 10x0)** → llama.cpp only — vLLM needs sm_75+.

Full hardware-acceleration matrix (which dtypes/quants run on Tensor Cores natively vs in software, per GPU class) at [DTYPE_MATRIX.md](DTYPE_MATRIX.md), including the weight-only vs weight+activation axis and the NVFP4 / MXFP4 / FP6 Blackwell additions.

### Does this work on AMD / Intel / Apple Silicon?

vLLM: NVIDIA-only (CUDA). llama.cpp: yes — pick the right Docker image (`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-rocm` for AMD, `:server` for CPU-only, or build from source for Apple Silicon). Update the `image:` line in the compose. The flags (`--ngl`, `-fa on`, `--cache-type-k q4_0`) work identically across backends.

### Does this work on Windows / WSL2?

Yes — both engines work on WSL2. Make sure GPU passthrough is set up (`nvidia-smi` works inside WSL). Native Windows: vLLM doesn't support it; llama.cpp does — but use a native llama.cpp build, not Docker.

**WSL2 adds ~1.3 GiB of invisible GPU overhead** — the Windows display driver, CUDA runtime, and WDDM reserve VRAM that `nvidia-smi` doesn't report at idle but is locked once a container starts. On a 24 GB card that leaves you with **~22.7 GB usable** instead of 24 GB.

**Dual-card vLLM**: mostly unaffected. Each card runs at ~17 GB with ~7 GB headroom — 1.3 GB overhead is noise.

**Single-card vLLM**: drop a `.env` with `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.94` (default 0.95 assumes headless Linux). Already documented with a combined `.env` template — see [HARDWARE.md WSL2 section](HARDWARE.md#note-for-wsl2--windows-users).

**Single-card llama.cpp / ik_llama**: this is the gap. llama.cpp composes allocate by fixed sizes, not a utilization ratio, so there's no `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` knob to dial. The shipped defaults are tight for headless Linux:

| Compose | Default ctx | Total VRAM | Headroom on Linux | Headroom on WSL2 | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `llamacpp/mtp` | 262K | 22.5 GB | ~1.5 GB | **~0.2 GB** | ❌ will OOM |
| `llamacpp/mtp` | **131K** | 20.0 GB | ~4.0 GB | **~2.7 GB** | ✅ safe |
| `llamacpp/mtp-vision` | 160K | 22.3 GB | ~1.7 GB | **~0.4 GB** | ⚠️ marginal |
| `llamacpp/mtp-vision` | **131K** | ~21 GB | ~3.0 GB | **~1.7 GB** | ✅ safe |
| `ik-llama/iq4ks-mtp` | 262K | 20.6 GB | ~3.4 GB | **~2.1 GB** | ✅ safe |
| `ik-llama/iq4ks-mtp-vision` | 160K | ~21 GB | ~3.0 GB | **~1.7 GB** | ✅ safe |

**Fix**: on WSL2, lower the context for the mainline llama.cpp composes:

```sh
# llamacpp/mtp — drop to 131K for WSL2 headroom
CTX_SIZE=131072 UBATCH_SIZE=1024 docker compose -f models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/compose/single/mtp.yml up -d

# llamacpp/mtp-vision — drop to 131K
CTX_SIZE=131072 UBATCH_SIZE=1024 docker compose -f models/qwen3.6-27b/llama-cpp/compose/single/mtp-vision.yml up -d
```

The ik_llama composes (IQ4_KS quants are smaller, ~15.1 GB weights) fit at defaults on WSL2.

**Other WSL2 gotchas** (all documented in [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md#note-for-wsl2--windows-users)):

1. **TDR timeout** — Windows force-resets the GPU after 2 seconds of kernel time. Long-context prompts trigger this. Fix: extend TDR to 60s via registry.
2. **PyTorch `expandable_segments` crash** — `device not ready` at `gptq_marlin_repack` on some WSL2 drivers. Fix: `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False`.
3. **GDN activation spike** — OOM at ~50-65K tokens on reduced-VRAM rigs. Fix: `VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1` (vLLM only, ~20-30% TPS cost).

Combined `.env` for vLLM single-card WSL2 (drop into `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/compose/.env`):

```sh
GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.94
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False,max_split_size_mb:512
VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1
```

## Engine choice

Different trades. vLLM is faster (51-89 TPS depending on config) and has full feature support (vision · tools · MTP spec-decode · streaming · reasoning). As of 2026-04-30 PM **Cliff 1 (25K tool prefills) is closed**. ⚠️ **As of 2026-05-05 Cliff 2 (>50K single-prompts) regressed under Genesis v7.72.2** — PN59 streaming-GDN was advertised as the structural fix but doesn't engage on the chunked-prefill code path that 24 GB single-card configs are forced to take. Filed at [Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#22](https://github.com/Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches/issues/22). For >50K single-prompt or full-262K cold context, **llama.cpp single (~21 TPS, no cliffs at 262K) or vLLM dual TP=2 (88-127 TPS, 262K verified at 237K) are the safe paths**. See the launch frame: [vLLM dual = max throughput, llama.cpp single = max robustness](../README.md#tldr--what-this-is).

### Why not Ollama?

Ollama wraps llama.cpp with a different model registry and slightly easier UX. It's fine for chat. Two reasons we don't ship it:
1. Ollama doesn't expose all llama.cpp flags we need (`--cache-type-k q4_0`, `--mmproj`, `--spec-type ngram-mod`, custom `--parallel`).
2. Ollama's model registry doesn't have the exact Unsloth GGUF quants we ship (UD-Q3_K_XL).
You can run Ollama against an Unsloth GGUF manually, but at that point you've reimplemented our llama.cpp compose with a different wrapper.

### Why not LM Studio?

LM Studio is GUI-driven and great for hobbyist use. We ship CLI/Docker because:
- Reproducibility — pinned image SHAs + Genesis commit make exact bench runs across machines possible
- Headless deployment — homelab racks, dev backends
- Tool-call extraction across both engines on this exact model is non-trivial; LM Studio's defaults haven't been validated

Use LM Studio if you prefer a GUI and don't need the engineering. Use this repo if you want a tested config that another club-3090 user can match exactly.

### Why MTP and not EAGLE?

We tried EAGLE — it's blocked on Qwen3-Next (the family Qwen3.5/3.6 belong to) by DeltaNet hybrid attention's lack of KV rollback support in vLLM/SGLang. MTP works because it's a different protocol (multi-token prediction at draft-head level, not a separate draft model). See [INTERNALS.md "Speculative decoding"](../models/qwen3.6-27b/INTERNALS.md) for the full forensic chain. **Re-test triggers:** if vllm#39931 lands or DeltaNet rollback support arrives upstream, EAGLE becomes viable again.

### The model I want isn't in the supported list — can I still run it?

Yes, if it's a **safetensors** repo. As of v0.8.0, `scripts/pull.sh <org/Model> --profile-like vllm/minimal --dry-run` evaluates *any* safetensors HF repo against this stack's KV math — no download — and tells you honestly whether it fits and at what confidence. Drop `--dry-run` (add `--yes`) and, if it passes the gates, it downloads, generates a minimal compose, and boots it. Non-fits stop with a precise reason, not a crash. Full guide: [docs/PULL.md](PULL.md). One heads-up: many common archs (e.g. `Qwen2ForCausalLM`) stop at `needs-trust-remote-code-ack` on the first try even with `--dry-run` — add `--trust-remote-code` (after checking what code the repo runs) to clear it. Limits: safetensors + vLLM only; GGUF / `.bin` repos abort at derive as `unsupported-format` (not a crash) — see next Q.

### Why not GGUF on vLLM for this model?

Multiple gates blocked. Qwen3.6-27B GGUF on vLLM hits a chain of "fixed but-not-quite" issues — multimodal config routing, ParallelLMHead skip, the `Qwen35TensorProcessor._reverse_reorder_v_heads` weight loader producing garbage output on the 27B layout (transformers PR #45283 only validated on 0.8B). Tracked in [INTERNALS.md](../models/qwen3.6-27b/INTERNALS.md#qwen36-27b-gguf-on-vllm). Use llama.cpp for GGUF on this model. **Note (v0.8.0):** `pull` evaluates *safetensors* repos only — GGUF→llama.cpp is **not** served via `pull` (it stays the curated/manual path; cross-engine generation is deliberately deferred). A GGUF/`.bin` repo aborts cleanly at the deriver stage as `unsupported-format` (the message is generic — it does not yet say "GGUF, use llama.cpp"; a clearer message is a tracked v0.8.1 follow-up), not a crash.

### Why AutoRound INT4 not GPTQ / AWQ?

AutoRound (Lorbus) gave us +9% TPS over AWQ on this model. GPTQ has a similar quality bar but the AWQ + DFlash path failed (pad-Marlin × aux-layer interaction). AutoRound + Genesis + MTP is the production-validated path. AWQ is documented as a fallback for users who can't use AutoRound.

## Performance

### Why is single-card TPS lower than I expected?

Look at the [TPS chart](../README.md#measured-tps-at-a-glance) — single-card vLLM is 51-55 TPS narrative / 67-70 code at 48K, which beats most consumer-3090 numbers we've seen reported. If you're seeing materially lower, the most common causes are:
1. Power cap < 230 W (this rig benches at 230 W; 280 W gives ~+5%, 350 W ~+10%)
2. Wrong compose for your prompt shape (use the `docker-compose.yml` 48K default for chat — don't pick `long-vision.yml` if you don't need 198K)
3. Genesis tree drift — `git pull origin main` between bench runs can change AL by ±15%. We pin to commit `bf667c7` for this reason.

### My TPS dropped after switching to 198K context. Why?

It shouldn't, much — we measured 50.93 TPS narr at 192K vs 50.53 at 32K (within variance) on `long-vision.yml` pre-fix; the new 198K + 0.98 config is in the same range. If it dropped a lot, you're probably actually decoding *into* a long ctx (not just having KV pool reserved). Loaded-context decode is 2-4× cold short-prompt decode on any LLM. The TPS chart number is short-prompt cold; loaded numbers are in [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### What's a "prefill cliff"?

VRAM-related OOM during prompt processing on single-card vLLM. Two cliffs documented:
- **Cliff 1** — historical: FFN intermediate buffer (`SiluAndMul` output, 138 MiB at `max_num_batched_tokens=4128 × intermediate_size=17408 × 2 bytes`) fresh-allocated per layer. Plus a related FA2 softmax_lse cap-leak ([Dao-AILab/flash-attention#1011](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/issues/1011)). **Closed on every shipped vLLM single-card variant** as of 2026-04-30 PM: `tools-text.yml` via Genesis PN8 (frees ~900 MiB on FP8 path); `long-vision.yml` and `long-text.yml` via the PN12 anchor sidecar (PR #13 to Sandermage's repo) plus a local P104 FA softmax_lse clamp. Full diagnostic: [docs/CLIFFS.md](CLIFFS.md).
- **Cliff 2** — DeltaNet GDN forward OOM at ~50-60K single-prompt regardless of mem-util. ⚠️ **Regressed under Genesis v7.72.2** (2026-05-05): PN59 streaming-GDN was advertised as the structural fix but doesn't engage on the chunked-prefill code path 24 GB single-card configs are forced to take. `long-text.yml` / `long-text-no-mtp.yml` / `long-vision.yml` may OOM at >50K single-prompt context. Filed at [Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches#22](https://github.com/Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches/issues/22) with reproducer + 4 fix proposals; pending Sander review. **Workarounds**: dual-card TP=2 (`dual.yml` / `dual-turbo.yml` — verified at 237K) or llama.cpp single-card (262K, different engine, no Cliff 2b). Tracked in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md).

For the full deep dive — empirical bisection, root-cause walk-through, who-can-fix-it landscape, and what we could do at any difficulty level — see [docs/CLIFFS.md](CLIFFS.md).

### vllm#40914 keeps coming up — what is it?

Sandermage's K+1 verify routing PR for TurboQuant spec-decode. We tested a local post-#41434 rebase on 2026-05-11 and it is **not** enough for our Qwen3.6-27B Genesis-free TQ+MTP path: MTP acceptance becomes perfect, but long-context recall corrupts into repeated tokens and tool/multi-turn paths regress. Removing the overlay is better, but TQ3/TQ4/k8v4 + MTP still fail needle recall.

The working paths today are `dual/tq3-nomtp.yml` without Genesis, or Genesis-backed TQ+MTP with P67/P67b. Treat #40914 as adjacent upstream work, not a shippable closure for this stack.

### What's PN8?

A Genesis patch (`GENESIS_ENABLE_PN8_MTP_DRAFT_ONLINE_QUANT=1`) added in v7.62.x — backport of vllm#40849 that makes the MTP draft head inherit the target model's online-quant config. We measured ~800-900 MiB freed on the FP8+MTP single-card path (`tools-text.yml`), which **closes Cliff 1 there**. No-op on TQ3 paths. Enabled by default in `tools-text.yml` since 2026-04-29; opt-in elsewhere via the env var if you want to test.

### INT8 PTH gives me 150 TPS single-stream but doesn't scale with concurrency — is that a bug?

Not a bug — it's the canonical signature of `int8_per_token_head` quantization. INT8 PTH stores a separate scale per (token, head) pair, so at single-stream the dequant is cheap; at concurrency the per-token-head scale-lookup + dequant becomes a serialization point. fp8 has a single global scale, so dequant is essentially free regardless of how many concurrent streams are decoding. This is why INT8 PTH lands high on single-stream throughput but stays flat as you add concurrent requests, while fp8 starts lower per-stream but scales near-linearly.

This shows up clearly in the head-to-head matrix on dual-3090:

- **INT8 PTH** (`dual/int8.yml`) — 85 narr / 121 code TPS single-stream, 605K KV pool / 2.31× concurrency at 262K, p50 decode TPS stays near baseline at concurrency (no aggregate lift)
- **fp8 default** (`dual/docker-compose.yml`) — lower per-stream but scales to ~9× concurrency at 262K, aggregate throughput goes up almost linearly with stream count

So pick by workload: INT8 PTH if you want max single-stream TPS and don't need many concurrent users; fp8 if you want aggregate throughput across many streams. If you want **both** — high single-stream *and* high concurrency on the same compose — the answer is the Genesis-backed TQ3+MTP path (`dual/tq3-mtp-genesis.yml`): 89 / 119 narr / code TPS single-stream + 1.22M KV pool / 4.66× concurrency on the same PCIe dual-3090 rig (~5pp quality cost vs INT8 PTH on the 150-scenario quality suite, within noise on aider-polyglot-30 — see [docs/TQ3_MTP_GENESIS.md](TQ3_MTP_GENESIS.md) for the full writeup). This is also why `dual/turbo.yml` (4-stream production variant) ships TQ3+MTP rather than INT8 PTH — INT8 PTH wouldn't scale across the 4 concurrent streams.

If your numbers on the same compose look different from ours by >15%, the most likely sources of the gap are: power cap (370W vs 290W = ~10-15%), vLLM nightly (pre-#41434 was ~15% slower on Qwen3-Next due to GPU↔CPU syncs in attention), Genesis patches loaded vs not (~10-15% via P67 + PN12 + PN25 on Qwen3-Next), MTP `n` value, or the prompt shape. Run `bash scripts/rebench-full.sh` to capture the canonical 5-phase numbers and we can compare apples-to-apples — see the [Numbers from your rig](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/new?template=numbers-from-your-rig.yml) issue template to share them back.

If you're running an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that **isn't** one of our pre-baked Docker composes — `llama-swap`, `ramalama`, a host-build `llama-server`, `ik_llama.cpp`, raw vLLM, etc. — pass it explicitly:

```bash
bash scripts/rebench-full.sh \
  --url http://HOST:PORT \
  --model 'served-model-name' \
  --engine vllm|llama-cpp|sglang|other
```

The chained scripts run in host-only mode (no `docker logs` / `docker inspect` scrapes) when `--url` is set, so the entire suite works against any OpenAI-API endpoint.

## Community

### Where can I ask quick questions or hang out with other users?

- **Discord** — [discord.gg/3t6UKFGhKw](https://discord.gg/3t6UKFGhKw). Synchronous, casual; good for "I'm stuck, can someone eyeball this" type questions.
- **GitHub Discussions** — [discussions tab](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions). Searchable, async, links cleanly to issues/PRs. Best for cross-rig bench drops, longer threads worth preserving.
- **GitHub Issues** — [issues tab](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues). Bug reports + regression repros only — please use the [triage ladder](#before-symptom-matching--boot-the-simplest-stack-first) before filing.

## Setup

### How do I pick the right model + variant?

For a first install, run `bash scripts/setup.sh` with no model argument in a normal terminal. It opens a hardware-aware model picker, marks Qwen / Gemma / Both as eligible or not for your detected GPUs, then continues into the existing download flow.

After setup, run `bash scripts/launch.sh`. The wizard asks which model (filtered to what you've downloaded), then which GPU(s) to use, auto-picks TP for homogeneous sets (PP for heterogeneous), filters variants by hardware fit, shows a per-card VRAM projection from `tools/kv-calc.py` for the suggested default, then boots and runs `verify-full.sh`. Power-user forms still work: `bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b`, `bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/dual`, partial flags like `bash scripts/launch.sh --model qwen3.6-27b --gpus 0,1` (skips prompts), `--tp 4 --pp 2` to override parallelism, plus `setup.sh --help` / `launch.sh --help` for the full flag list. This wizard covers the **curated catalog**; for a model *not* in the catalog (any safetensors HF repo), use `scripts/pull.sh` instead — see [docs/PULL.md](PULL.md).

### `bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b` is downloading 20+ GB. Where does it go? / Can I put models on a different drive?

Yes. The knob is `MODEL_DIR`, with **four ways** to set it (priority order):

1. **`MODEL_DIR` env var in your shell** — takes precedence over everything:
   ```bash
   export MODEL_DIR=/mnt/your-second-drive/models
   bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b
   ```
2. **`.env` file at repo root** — picked up automatically on every script run. See [`.env.example`](../.env.example).
3. **Interactive prompt** — `bash scripts/setup.sh` with nothing set first asks which model to download, then offers three model-dir choices: in-repo default, `~/models`, or custom path. After you pick custom, it asks "Save `MODEL_DIR=/your/path` to `.env` so we skip this next time?" — say `Y` and it persists for every subsequent `launch.sh` / `switch.sh` / `bench.sh` call.
4. **Silent fallback** — `<repo>/models-cache/`. Functional but pollutes the git tree; not recommended.

Every script that touches model paths reads from the same `MODEL_DIR`. The compose YAMLs' volume mount is `${MODEL_DIR:-...}:/root/.cache/huggingface` — once set, every container reads + writes there.

**HF env-var integration** — we don't directly respect `HF_HOME` / `HF_HUB_CACHE` because we mount a host directory INTO the container's `/root/.cache/huggingface`, not the host's HF cache. The internal layout inside `MODEL_DIR` matches HF's repo-cache convention (`<MODEL_DIR>/<repo-subdir>/`), so models downloaded by `setup.sh` are byte-compatible with anything that reads HF's local cache layout. Two clean workarounds if you already have an HF cache you want to reuse:
- Set `MODEL_DIR=$HF_HOME/hub`
- Or symlink between them

**On Windows / WSL2** — same mechanism. Docker Desktop handles path translation. Use Windows paths (`D:\models`) from PowerShell or WSL paths (`/mnt/d/models`) from WSL. If you flip between Linux and Windows on the same rig, point `MODEL_DIR` at a drive both OSes can see — the model files themselves are OS-agnostic.

### How do I keep my install up-to-date?

Run `bash scripts/update.sh`. It does the safe sequence:

1. Refuses if your tree has uncommitted edits — `git status` shows you what to commit/stash first. (We don't clobber the rare user who's tweaked a compose locally.)
2. `git pull --ff-only origin master` — no merge commits, no rebase ambiguity. If your branch has diverged, you'll get a clear pointer to resolve manually.
3. Re-runs `bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b` so any Genesis-pin bump or vendored-patch update on master gets applied to your tree.
4. Tells you to restart your container via `bash scripts/switch.sh <variant>` — doesn't auto-restart, so you can A/B old-vs-new before bringing the new variant up.

Flags:
- `--dry-run` — shows what would happen without changing anything.
- `--force` — re-runs `setup.sh` even when up-to-date (e.g. after you hand-edited the Genesis tree and want it re-pinned).
- `MODEL=<other-model> bash scripts/update.sh` — defaults to `qwen3.6-27b`.

You'll usually find out you're behind before you ask: `launch.sh` and `switch.sh` both run `preflight_repo_drift` at boot, which soft-warns when your local HEAD is behind `origin/master`, with the commit count + last-fetch age + the one-line fix. Opt out via `PREFLIGHT_NO_FETCH=1` for offline rigs.

If your *Genesis tree* (not the repo) is out of sync — the pin in `setup.sh` moved but you didn't re-run setup — `preflight_genesis_pin` warns separately and tells you to run `setup.sh`. That was the failure mode behind [#32](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/32) and wispborne's `_register_op_once` crash.

### My GPU isn't card 0 — how do I change it?

Use the `--gpus` flag: `bash scripts/launch.sh --gpus 2` (single-card) or `bash scripts/launch.sh --gpus 2,3` (two cards). The wizard exports `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for you. The older form `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/default` still works if you prefer to set the env yourself.

### Container fails to start: "Free memory ... is less than desired GPU memory utilization"

Looks like:

```
ValueError: Free memory on device cuda:0 (22.76/24.0 GiB) on startup
is less than desired GPU memory utilization (0.97, 23.28 GiB).
```

vLLM's startup check reserves `mem-util × total VRAM` of *currently-free* VRAM before booting. If something else on the GPU is holding memory (X11 / Wayland compositor, leftover container, Python process, browser GPU acceleration), the check fails. Most common on `tools-text.yml` (0.97) and the long-* variants (0.98 / 0.985).

Two fixes:
1. **Free the VRAM** (preferred). `nvidia-smi` shows what's holding it. Common: log out of GUI, stop a leftover container (`docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter "name=vllm-")`), or kill orphaned `python` processes.
2. **Lower mem-util** in the compose. e.g. on `tools-text.yml`: drop `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.97` to `0.94` and reduce `--max-model-len` proportionally (75K → ~70K). Loses ~6K context but works on any rig.

The 0.97 / 0.98 / 0.985 defaults assume a headless rig with ≥23.3 GiB consistently free. If you're running a desktop session on the same card, `0.92`–`0.94` is the safer ceiling.

### Can I run multiple variants at once on the same machine?

You'd need different ports per variant. Set `PORT=9876` in `.env` (or pass inline: `PORT=9876 bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/default`) — every shipped compose now reads `${PORT}` for the host-side port mapping. Watch VRAM — two configs simultaneously typically don't fit on 24 GB.

### Will this work behind Open WebUI?

Yes. Add a connection in Open WebUI's Settings → Connections → OpenAI: base URL `http://localhost:8020/v1`, any non-empty API key, model `qwen3.6-27b-autoround`. See [docs/EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#open-webui).

### Will this work with VS Code GitHub Copilot LLM Gateway?

Yes, but you need a compose with **≥48K context** — Copilot's LLM Gateway sends ~20K tokens of tool-schema preamble (50+ VS Code tools enumerated in a structured-outputs JSON schema) on every request, which alone consumes most of a small context budget. Use `tools-text.yml` (75K + fp8 + PN8 enabled — Cliff 1 closed):

```bash
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/tools-text
```

There's a second wrinkle: Copilot's LLM Gateway sometimes sends very low `max_tokens` (e.g. 64) on probe-style requests. With `tool_choice: required` (which Copilot enforces via `minItems: 1` on its structured-outputs schema), the model must emit a tool-call JSON that wraps a real argument like a file path — and 64 tokens isn't enough to fit `{"name": "read_file", "parameters": {"filePath": "/long/abs/path"}}`. The truncated JSON arrives at the gateway as "empty response." If you see this pattern, it's a client-side limit, not the server. Other OpenAI-compat clients (Cline / Continue.dev / Cursor) tend to send realistic max_tokens by default and don't hit this.

**Server-side fix landed 2026-04-29:** the Genesis P68/P69 long-context tool-adherence patches were silently overriding `tool_choice: auto → required` and injecting "must use a tool" reminders whenever prompt > 8000 chars. That made greetings + clarifying questions stall on every IDE-agent setup (Cline, Cursor, OpenCode, and Copilot Gateway combined). We disabled both in `tools-text.yml`. Behavior now: greeting → plain-text reply ("Hello! How can I help you today?"); tool request → clean `read_file({"path": "..."})` call. P64 and PN8 stay enabled (real targeted bugfixes, no user-intent override).

## Community / contribution

### Can I add my benchmark numbers from a different rig?

Please do — open an issue using the [Numbers from your rig](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/new?template=numbers-from-your-rig.yml) template. We collect cross-rig data points in BENCHMARKS for community signal.

### Found a bug — what should I include?

The [bug report template](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml) asks for the data we always need. The fastest way is one of these `report.sh` flag combos depending on bug type:

| Bug type | Command | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Boot crash, wrong output, tool-call regression | `bash scripts/report.sh --verify > my-rig.md` | ~2 min |
| OOM mid-conversation, hermes/openhands/IDE-agent failures (Cliff 2b) | `bash scripts/report.sh --soak > my-rig.md` | ~25 min |
| TPS regression / cross-rig perf | `bash scripts/report.sh --bench > my-rig.md` | ~5 min |
| Not sure / capture everything | `bash scripts/report.sh --full > my-rig.md` | ~35 min |

Each captures hardware, GPU details (incl. power caps), container state, Genesis patch status, KV pool sizing, and engine config in one paste. Skipping these means the first reply will just ask for them, costing you a round-trip.

### How do I bump Genesis to a newer commit?

That's only for testing a newer Genesis than what master ships — the normal "keep up with the stack" path is `bash scripts/update.sh` (covered above), which picks up whatever pin master currently declares.

For a one-off bump: `GENESIS_PIN=<new-commit-sha> bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b` and re-run `bash scripts/verify-full.sh` to confirm tools still work. Don't bump in production without re-running the verify suite — Genesis releases sometimes change spec-verify routing in ways that affect tool-call extraction.

## Troubleshooting

### My hermes / openhands / OpenCode / Cline / OpenClaw / Cursor session OOMs after a few turns. What do I do?

**Short answer:** route to `bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual` (if you have 2× 3090s) or `bash scripts/switch.sh llamacpp/default` (if 1× only). Single-card vLLM is **not safe** for accumulating-context multi-turn agent traffic on Qwen3.6-27B. We validated this 2026-05-03 across all six shipped single-card vLLM composes; only TP=2 and llama.cpp survive cleanly.

Symptoms users report: "performance degrades after 20 turns", "throughput drops to 0", "engine becomes unresponsive at ~30K tokens", "OOM after 4-5 turns of hermes", `chunk_fwd_o → torch.empty_like(v) → CUDA OOM`. All same root cause — Cliff 2b in [`docs/CLIFFS.md`](CLIFFS.md). Hardware-physical limit; not a tuning issue.

**Things you might try that don't work** (all tested):
- Lowering `--gpu-memory-utilization` (0.95 → 0.93 → 0.90) — buys ~258 MiB headroom, +1 turn buffer, doesn't close the cliff
- Disabling MTP — same +1 turn, doesn't close
- Reducing `--max-num-batched-tokens` below 4128 — blocked by Qwen3-Next Mamba block_size hard floor
- Setting `TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=1` — no effect on Ampere SM86 (the 5090 recovery others reported was Blackwell TMA-specific)
- `expandable_segments=True` — already on by default in our composes; doesn't fully repack
- `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between turns — reclaims allocator state but cliff still fires (next kernel needs more than reclaimed)
- Switching between `long-text`, `long-vision`, `tools-text`, `bounded-thinking`, `long-text-no-mtp`, `default` — all six FAIL; same kernel under accumulated KV pressure

**What does work** — verified by [running soak test](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/blob/master/scripts/soak-test.sh) under v2 continuous mode:

```bash
# 2× 3090 — TP=2 splits the failing kernel's working set
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual    # 111+ TPS p50, 0 errors, 0 MiB growth across 5 sessions

# 1× 3090 — different engine, different kernels, different allocator
bash scripts/switch.sh llamacpp/default      # 21 TPS, 262K context, cliff-immune, vision
bash scripts/switch.sh llamacpp/mtp          # ~60 code TPS, 131K, MTP, 7/7 verify-stress (incl. 91K needle)
bash scripts/switch.sh llamacpp/mtp-vision   # ~66 code TPS, 49K + vision (multimodal MTP — drop UBATCH_SIZE to 512 + raise CTX_SIZE to 196608 if you need long ctx; see SINGLE_CARD.md)
```

**Want to verify your rig hits the same class:**

```bash
git pull origin master    # or: bash scripts/update.sh
SOAK_MODE=continuous SOAK_SESSIONS=5 SOAK_TURNS=5 \
  CONTAINER=vllm-qwen36-27b-long-text \
  bash scripts/soak-test.sh
```

~20 min. Will OOM at session 1 turn 4-5 with `chunk_fwd_o → empty_like(v)` if same class. If it PASSes on your rig, you've found a different signature than what we've tracked — please file an issue with the soak summary.

**What's in flight:** Genesis sidecar streaming refactor of `chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd` being filed with Sandermage. ETA 2-4 weeks if accepted. Check [#41](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/41) for the canonical fix-tracking thread.

**Why this happens** (one-paragraph): the GDN forward kernel holds ~500 MiB of simultaneous intermediate tensors at T=4128 prefill chunks. With accumulated multi-turn KV cache (~5 GiB at 25K context) + model weights (14 GiB) + MTP draft (5 GiB) + other workspace, the per-card peak exceeds the 24 GiB ceiling. The fix is rewriting the kernel to stream those intermediates segment-by-segment instead of holding them simultaneously — that's upstream work in `vllm/model_executor/layers/fla/ops/` or via Genesis sidecar. Detailed mechanism analysis in [`docs/CLIFFS.md`](CLIFFS.md) "Why TP=2 escapes" and "Why llama.cpp escapes" sections.

### Random crashes under sustained load on an AMD platform (Threadripper / Ryzen / EPYC)?

Intermittent crashes during long runs — a `tokenizers` Rust segfault (`free(): invalid next size`), a Triton "unspecified launch failure", or both GPUs dropping out at once — are often the **AMD-Vi IOMMU** faulting under sustained TP=2 DMA, not a model bug. Check the kernel log:

```bash
dmesg | grep -E "AMD-Vi.*IO_PAGE_FAULT|Xid.*154"
```

If you see `AMD-Vi … IO_PAGE_FAULT` + `Xid … 154`, add **`iommu=pt`** to your kernel command line — the IOMMU stays on (isolation / PCIe grouping intact) but device DMA bypasses page-table translation, which clears it. No-op on Intel. Full writeup + kernel-log signature in [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md) ("Note for AMD platforms"). Diagnosed by @mgabor3141 ([#178](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/178)).

## Troubleshooting ladder — boot the simplest stack first

If you're hitting boot OOMs, weird MTP behavior, or memory-budget issues
on TQ3 / long-context configs, validate that your hardware + driver +
container runtime + model files are fundamentally sound by booting the
simplest variant first. Each step adds **one variable** on top of the
previous; if step N works and step N+1 fails, the new variable is the
cause.

| Step | Variant | Adds | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `vllm/minimal` | base vLLM, nothing else | hardware, driver, Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, model files |
| 2 | `vllm/tools-text` | + Genesis + MTP K=3 + fp8 KV | Genesis patch tree + MTP spec-decode + fp8 KV path |
| 3 | `vllm/long-text` | + TQ3 KV + 180K context | TurboQuant + long-ctx + production single-card stack |
| 4 | `vllm/dual` | + TP=2, **removes Genesis** | TP=2 NCCL + multi-GPU memory split (single-card layer no longer in scope) |
| 5 | `vllm/dual-turbo` | + TQ3 + Genesis on TP=2 | full multi-card stack |

**At-a-glance:** if you're single-card-only, run steps 1-3. If you're
dual-card and step 3 fails, the bug is in single-card; if step 3 works
but step 4 fails, it's TP=2 NCCL specifically; if step 4 works but step
5 fails, it's the TQ3-on-TP=2-with-Genesis intersection.

**Step 1 — `vllm/minimal` (32K + fp8 + no Genesis + no spec-decode)**

```bash
bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/minimal
```

Tests: hardware, driver, Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, model files,
base vLLM. Strips out everything that could be the cause.

- ✅ Boots cleanly → your stack is fundamentally sound. Continue to step 2.
- ❌ Fails — the issue is fundamental (driver mismatch, model files
  missing or corrupt, container runtime, base vLLM image). Fix at this
  layer before trying anything else. Symptom-match against the table
  below or run `bash scripts/report.sh --verify > my-rig.md` and file a bug.

**Step 2 — `vllm/tools-text` (75K + fp8 + MTP + Genesis)**

```bash
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/tools-text
```

Adds: Genesis patches + MTP K=3 spec-decode. Still fp8 KV (no TQ3 yet).

- ✅ Boots cleanly → Genesis + MTP layer is sound. Continue to step 3.
- ❌ Fails — narrow to Genesis or MTP specifically. Most common gap:
  on-disk Genesis tree at `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/genesis/`
  out of sync with `GENESIS_PIN` in `scripts/setup.sh`. Re-run
  `bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b` to refresh the tree.

**Step 3 — `vllm/long-text` (180K + TQ3 + MTP + full Genesis)**

```bash
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/long-text
```

Adds: TurboQuant 3-bit KV + long-context handling. This is the
production-target single-card config.

- ✅ Boots cleanly → single-card stack fully validated. If you only
  need single-card, stop here — this is what we ship as the IDE-agent
  default.
- ❌ Fails — narrow to TQ3 or long-context specifically. If `tools-text`
  worked but `long-text` doesn't, the issue is in TQ3 KV setup, GDN
  cliff envelope (>60K single prompts hit the hardware wall on 24 GB),
  or Cliff 1 mech B compile-path (closed since v7.66 + PN25 — confirm
  Genesis tree is at v7.69 = `2db18df`).

**Step 4 — `vllm/dual` (262K + fp8 + TP=2 + 2 streams, Genesis-less)**

For dual-card users only. `dual.yml` is **intentionally Genesis-less**
(per its YAML header) — fp8 KV + TP=2 doesn't trigger the cudagraph
bug class Genesis was built to patch.

```bash
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual
```

Adds: TP=2 NCCL coordination + multi-GPU memory split. Removes Genesis.

- ✅ Boots cleanly with steps 1-3 also passing → TP=2 path works. If
  `long-text` (single-card with Genesis) AND `dual` (TP=2 without
  Genesis) both work but `dual-turbo` (TP=2 + TQ3 + Genesis) doesn't,
  the bug is specifically in the TQ3-on-TP=2-with-Genesis intersection.
- ❌ Fails despite step 3 working — the issue is in TP=2 NCCL
  coordination or multi-GPU memory budget. WSL2 is the most common
  trigger here (its vGPU layer adds memory accounting wrinkles that
  bare-metal Linux doesn't have); native Linux + 2× 3090 PCIe is
  well-tested. If you're on WSL2 and hitting this, native Linux or
  switching to single-card `long-text` is the off-ramp.

**Step 5 — `vllm/dual-turbo` (262K + TQ3 + TP=2 + 4 streams, full Genesis)**

```bash
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual-turbo
```

Adds: TQ3 KV + Genesis on top of TP=2 + 4-stream concurrency.

- ✅ Boots and verify-stress passes → full dual-card stack validated.
- ❌ Fails despite steps 3 and 4 working — the bug is specifically in
  the multi-card TQ3+Genesis intersection. File a bug with
  `bash scripts/report.sh --full > my-rig.md` output; this is a narrow
  surface we'd want to debug carefully and the full pass (verify + stress
  + soak + bench) gives us everything to triage in one paste.

## Why this works for both single and dual-card users

The first 3 steps isolate stack layers (base → Genesis+MTP+fp8 →
TQ3+long-ctx). Steps 4-5 add TP=2 surface separately. A user on dual
hardware who's hitting issues should still run steps 1-3 on a single
card first — it's the only way to tell apart "issue in single-card
stack that also breaks dual" from "issue specific to TP=2 NCCL /
multi-GPU coordination."

## Quick recognition guide for common failure modes

- **Container dies at boot with `GPTQ_MARLIN_MIN_THREAD_N (64) > out_features`** — dual-card vllm#40361 patch didn't apply. Confirm `/opt/ai/engines/vllm/primary/` exists with the patched marlin kernel files.
- **Container dies during DFlash boot** — vllm#40334 dtype mismatch. Verify the compose has `--dtype bfloat16`.
- **Tool calls return `<tool_call>` as plain text** — Genesis didn't apply. Check `Genesis Results: 27 applied` in logs (boot-time).
- **OOM during prefill at 60K+ tokens** — single-card Cliff 2 (DeltaNet GDN forward). 60K is the closed envelope on `long-text.yml` (Balanced MTP) and `long-text-no-mtp.yml` (Max-context); >60K still hits the hardware-physical wall on 24 GB. For larger prompts: switch to dual-card TP=2 or llama.cpp + q4_0 KV.
- **OOM during prefill at 25K+ tool response** — historically Cliff 1 on TQ3 paths. **Closed since 2026-04-30 PM** via PN12 anchor sidecar on `long-vision.yml` / `long-text.yml`. If you're hitting it, check your compose has the sidecar wired in (`patch_pn12_ffn_pool_anchor.py` in entrypoint).
- **WSL2: GPU OOM at model load with `Tried to allocate ~44 MiB` despite ample free VRAM** — misleading error message. Real cause is host RAM constraint at the model loader: WSL2 by default allocates 50% of Windows host RAM (or 8 GB, whichever is smaller). The 17.69 GB checkpoint won't fit if WSL2 has <18 GB available, vLLM disables auto-prefetch, falls back to a slow streaming path, and TP=2 concurrent loading fragments the CUDA allocator. **Fix:** edit `C:\Users\<You>\.wslconfig` to set `[wsl2]\nmemory=24GB\nswap=8GB`, run `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell, restart your WSL terminal, then `free -h` should show 24Gi total. The smoking-gun log line if you suspect this: `[weight_utils.py:934] Auto-prefetch is disabled because ... checkpoint size (17.69 GiB) exceeds 90% of available RAM`. Captured automatically in `bash scripts/report.sh` boot-log highlights. First documented: [#32](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/32#issuecomment-4364986469) (RossNE99's repro).
- **"Empty response" through VS Code Copilot LLM Gateway** — Copilot sends ~20K tokens of tool schemas + sometimes uses `max_tokens=64` which truncates tool-call JSON. Switch to `tools-text.yml` (75K) and check Copilot's max_tokens setting. See [#2](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/2) for full debug-log analysis.
- **Per-stream TPS lower than expected** — re-run `bench.sh` with 3+ warmups + 5 measured runs first. Run-to-run variance is ~5%.

If none match, open an issue with `docker logs <container> 2>&1 | tail -200` + `nvidia-smi` — see [`bug-report.yml` template](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml).
