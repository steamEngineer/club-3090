# Pull — serve any HF safetensors model (v0.8.0)

**User guide.** You have a Hugging Face model and you want to know: *will it
run on my GPUs, and if so, how?* `scripts/pull.sh` answers that — it
evaluates the repo against this stack's precise KV math before you download
anything, and is honest about how much it trusts the answer.

> **v0.8.0 headline:** *"Evaluate any safetensors HF repo; pull only
> vLLM-loadable supported ones, and only when the gates pass (or an explicit
> override is accepted)."*

This is the **user front door**. For the contributor/maintainer internals
of the same pipeline (gate strata, classifier, trust pipeline) start at
[`docs/README.md`](README.md) → the Contributor track.

## What changed in v0.8.0

Older releases worked one way: the repo *formally supported* a fixed list
of models, and you picked from that list. That still works and still ships
— see [`docs/SINGLE_CARD.md`](SINGLE_CARD.md) /
[`docs/DUAL_CARD.md`](DUAL_CARD.md) / [`docs/MULTI_CARD.md`](MULTI_CARD.md),
the curated catalog is unchanged.

v0.8.0 **adds** a model-agnostic front door. The stack no longer needs to
"formally support model X" per release to be useful for X. Instead:

- You hand `pull` *any* safetensors HF repo slug.
- It derives the model's shape from the repo's own `config.json` and runs
  it through this stack's KV math.
- It returns a verdict **with an explicit confidence tier**, and tells you
  which gate decided.

The curated catalog doesn't go away — it becomes the **calibration
backbone**: the measured corpus the math is anchored against. Curated
models get an `exact` confidence tier; arbitrary repos get an honest
lower-bound estimate. Both are first-class; the difference is stated, never
hidden.

## Usage

```
scripts/pull.sh <hf-slug> --profile-like <COMPOSE_REGISTRY-key> [opts]
```

`--profile-like` is **required**: it names a curated registry key that
supplies the runtime shape (engine, KV format, TP) to evaluate against.

### Path A — curated pull-and-emit

The slug is a curated, generator-emittable model. On a gate-passing run
`pull` hands the validated key to the #141 compose generator and emits a
ready compose.

```
scripts/pull.sh Lorbus/Qwen3.6-27B-int4-AutoRound \
    --profile-like vllm/minimal --out qwen.yml
```

### Path B — universal evaluate (never downloads, never emits)

Any non-curated slug, or `--dry-run` on anything, takes Path B. It prints
a confidence-tiered verdict and **never calls the generator and never
downloads weights**.

```
scripts/pull.sh some-org/Some-Llama-7B --profile-like vllm/minimal --dry-run
```

### Options

| Opt | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--yes` | Accept a `confirm→proceed` terminal (§4.1 — see "Reading the verdict"). |
| `--force-download` | Advisory low-confidence `wont-fit` → `override-accepted`. **No-op + notice this phase** (download deferred to a later phase). |
| `--experimental-arch` | Bypass *only* a `[C0] engine-support-unknown` (no arch row) hard-block; attempt with default vLLM settings. Path B only this phase. |
| `--trust-remote-code` | Bypass a `[C0] needs-trust-remote-code-ack` hard-block (security decision — see below). |
| `--hf-home DIR` | Override the `HF_HOME` resolution chain (where disk is checked / weights would land). |
| `--out FILE` | Path A: write the emitted compose here. |
| `--hardware SM` | Override detected GPU compute capability (e.g. `8.6` for RTX 3090); default = `nvidia-smi`. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Download-eligible / clean verdict. |
| `3` | Needs a flag — a `confirm→proceed` or advisory terminal that is not yet satisfied (re-run with the named flag). |
| `2` | Honest hard-stop (a gate aborted, or `hard-block`). |
| `64` | Usage error. |

## Reading the verdict

Every run prints the **confidence tier** and **which gate decided** — this
is non-negotiable: the gate never silently passes anything except an
`exact × fits-clean` case.

Two axes combine:

- **confidence** ∈ `{exact, estimated-lower-bound}` (a `derived` tier is
  reserved for a future phase). `exact` = a curated calibration anchor;
  `estimated-lower-bound` = a derived estimate where the modelled VRAM is a
  *floor* and is likely under-modelled.
- **raw_verdict** ∈ `{fits-clean, fits-constrained, wont-fit}` — the KV
  math's pure measurement, no policy.

The two map to a **terminal** ∈ `{proceed, confirm→proceed, hard-block,
override-accepted}`:

| confidence | `fits-clean` | `fits-constrained` | `wont-fit` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `exact` | **proceed** (silent — the only silent pass) | **confirm→proceed** (`--yes`; a constraint changed your requested config) | **hard-block** (math trusted; closest-fit suggested) |
| `estimated-lower-bound` | **confirm→proceed** (`--yes`; VRAM is a floor, likely under-modelled) | **confirm→proceed** (`--yes` + floor + constraint notice) | advisory → `--force-download` → **override-accepted** |

The output names the stratum/gate that decided. An illustrative Path B line
(shape derived from the tool's actual print sites — your values will
differ):

```
[pull] OK path=B stratum=DECIDED slug=some-org/Some-Llama-7B profile-like=vllm/minimal
[pull] confidence=estimated-lower-bound raw_verdict=fits-clean terminal=confirm→proceed
[pull] Path B verdict: [C1] estimated-lower-bound×fits-clean → confirm→proceed (VRAM is a floor; likely under-modeled)
[pull] note: boot-fit satisfied; this does NOT guarantee stability under sustained / accumulated-context workloads — validate with soak-continuous before relying on it (recommend: scripts/soak.sh SOAK_MODE=continuous).
```

`override-accepted` is **not** a gate-pass. It is the deliberate, explicit
path for forcing a low-confidence `wont-fit`: it records the outcome as a
calibration signal, it does not record "fit validated".

---

## Boot-fit ≠ runtime-stability — read this

The KV math is a **static, boot-time allocation** check. Passing it is
*necessary but not sufficient* for real workloads. On this hardware class,
measured failure modes exist that a static check cannot see:

- **Cliff 2** — degradation/OOM at roughly **21–26K accumulated context**
  under accumulated-context agent workloads (hermes/openhands style).
- **Prefill cliffs** at single-prompt sizes well below the static ceiling.
- **Cliff 2b** — only detectable under a *continuous soak*, not a single
  request.

So a `fits-clean` / `proceed` config can still degrade or OOM once a real
agent accumulates context. Honesty is non-negotiable on this stack, so the
verdict output always carries this caveat verbatim:

> *boot-fit satisfied; this does NOT guarantee stability under sustained /
> accumulated-context workloads — validate with soak-continuous before
> relying on it (recommend: scripts/soak.sh SOAK_MODE=continuous).*

**Before you rely on any `fits-clean` / `proceed` config in production,
run** `scripts/soak.sh SOAK_MODE=continuous` — it is the only test that
catches Cliff 2b. A `fits-clean` that silently dies under soak is exactly
the confidently-wrong outcome this design forbids; the soak makes the
*predicted* side honest about its scope. See [`docs/CLIFFS.md`](CLIFFS.md)
for the full diagnosis of these failure modes.

## `--trust-remote-code` — a security decision

Some HF repos ship custom modelling code that the loader executes. If the
architecture's matrix entry requires it, the gate **hard-blocks** with
`needs-trust-remote-code-ack` and prints what code origin would run. It
does not proceed until you explicitly pass `--trust-remote-code`. This is a
deliberate fail-closed security gate — *do not reflexively pass the flag to
clear an error*; understand what code you are authorizing first.

A genuinely unknown architecture (no entry in the patch matrix at all)
hard-blocks differently — with `engine-support-unknown`. Pass
`--experimental-arch` to attempt it anyway with default vLLM settings; the
outcome is captured to inform support coverage.

## What happens after a pass

`pull` itself stays user-level — it evaluates and (Path A) emits. For the
depth behind a passing run:

- **The download → boot → smoke path** for a download-eligible derived
  model: [`docs/PULL_EMIT_DERIVED.md`](PULL_EMIT_DERIVED.md) (the `[E]`
  stage).
- **The contribution loop** — how a boot/OOM outcome becomes a classified,
  deduped, consensus-keyable calibration signal:
  [`docs/LOOP.md`](LOOP.md) (the `[F]` stage).
- **The compose the generator emits** and how it is shaped:
  [`docs/COMPOSE_GENERATOR.md`](COMPOSE_GENERATOR.md).

---

## v0.8.1 — not yet (honest deferrals)

This release evaluates **safetensors only**. Deferred to a later release:

- **GGUF** repos (footer-first metadata derivation, multi-quant auto-pick).
- **`.bin`** / non-safetensors weight layouts.
- A whichllm-based hardware-detect slice and the full `recommend` UX.

If you point `pull` at a GGUF-only or `.bin`-only repo today, that is a
known gap, not a stack failure.
