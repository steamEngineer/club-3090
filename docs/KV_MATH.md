# KV Cache Math — predicting per-card VRAM budget

This page documents the math behind [`tools/kv-calc.py`](../tools/kv-calc.py) — the predictor that helps you decide whether a config will fit on your hardware *before* booting it. It also explains why predictions are estimates (±1.5 GB error band) rather than precise allocations.

Four model families are documented:

| Model | Status | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen 3.6 27B** (dense) | Calibrated 11/11 on this stack | Qwen3-Next hybrid: 16 full-attention + 48 GDN (Gated DeltaNet) layers |
| **Gemma 4 31B** (dense) | Calibrated 7/7 on this stack | Sliding-window + dense MLP: 50 SWA + 10 full-attention layers |
| **Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B** (MoE) | **Config-verified, calibration pending** | Qwen3-Next hybrid + MoE: 30 GDN + 10 gated-attention layers. Confirmed from `config.json` 2026-05-15 — see [Qwen section](#qwen-36-35b-a3b-moe--per-card-budget-components). |
| **Gemma 4 26B-A4B** (MoE) | **Config-verified, calibration pending** | Sliding-window + dense MoE: 25 SWA + 5 full-attention layers. **Asymmetric KV heads** (8 sliding / 2 global). Confirmed from `config.json` 2026-05-15 — see [Gemma section](#gemma-4-26b-a4b-moe--per-card-budget-components). |

For models marked **config-verified, calibration pending**: architectural facts (layer counts, head dims, K=V tying, MoE expert counts, layer-type pattern) are sourced directly from the on-disk `config.json` and `layer_types` arrays — not estimates. What remains pending is the **empirical activation-peak coefficient** for each (model, KV-format) pair, which needs ≥4 measured BENCHMARKS rows per model. See [Sources of Error & Accuracy](#sources-of-error--accuracy) at the end.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Qwen 3.6 27B — what's my budget if I run dual-turbo on 20 GB cards?
bash tools/kv-calc.py --model qwen3.6-27b --compose dual-turbo --vram 20 --mem-util 0.82

# Gemma 4 31B — what's the largest max_ctx that fits on 24 GB cards with TP=2 + INT8 PTH KV?
bash tools/kv-calc.py --model gemma-4-31b --solve-max-ctx --tp 2 --kv-format int8_per_token_head --vram 24 --mem-util 0.92

# How accurate is the model? Show predicted vs measured for our shipped composes (both models):
bash tools/kv-calc.py --calibration

# Optional architecture-level cache breakdown for home/workstation rig planning:
bash tools/kv-calc.py --compose dual --vram 24 --gpus 2 --kv-breakdown

# Same fit path, but use calculator-style wording for concurrency:
bash tools/kv-calc.py --model qwen3.6-27b --max-ctx 32768 --sequences 2 --tp 2 --vram 24 --kv-breakdown
```

`--model` defaults to `qwen3.6-27b` for backward compatibility with earlier invocations.

The predictor is a directional estimator, not a precise allocator. The vLLM engine's `gpu_worker.py` boot-log report is authoritative — the calculator is for *before* boot.

## Home/workstation planning mode

`tools/kv-calc.py` is still a deployment-fit calculator first. Existing scripts and compose checks should keep using the calibrated prediction path (`predict()`, `raw_verdict()`, `--calibration`, `--json`) as the source of truth. The optional `--kv-breakdown` mode adds architecture-level cache buckets inspired by public KV calculators, but it is reporting-only unless a future profile explicitly opts into those fields.

Useful flags:

| Flag | Purpose | Default behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `--gpus N` | Physical GPUs in a single-node home/workstation rig. Informational; TP still controls memory sharding. | Defaults to `TP` |
| `--sequences N` | Calculator-style alias for `--max-num-seqs`. | Existing `--max-num-seqs` behavior |
| `--kv-breakdown` | Prints raw cache/state buckets in addition to the calibrated fit verdict. | Off |
| `--include-draft-kv --draft-kv-gb X` | Adds a per-card draft-KV estimate to the breakdown. Drafter weights remain modelled by `--drafter-gb`. | Off / 0 GB |
| `--compressed-layers`, `--compression-ratio`, `--compressed-head-dim` | Optional compressed/sparse KV estimate for future sparse-cache model families. | 0 layers |
| `--indexer-ratio-layers`, `--indexer-compress-ratio`, `--indexer-head-dim`, `--indexer-format` | Optional indexer-cache estimate for models with separate sparse-cache indexers. | 0 layers, `fp4` |

The intended envelope is local single-node rigs: 1-8 consumer/prosumer/workstation GPUs. This includes serious home workstations such as 4× RTX 6000-class rigs, but deliberately does not try to model datacenter scheduling, multi-node cache offload, or SLA/eviction policy.

Example output buckets:

```text
Cache architecture breakdown
----------------------------
  Layout:                   hybrid_mamba
  Scope:                    2 GPU(s), TP=2, sequences=2
  Attention KV — growing:     8.59 GB / card
  Recurrent / SSM state:      0.01 GB / card
  Cache/state subtotal:       8.60 GB / card
```

Important distinction: if `--compressed-*` or `--indexer-*` fields are used manually, they are architecture math estimates. The calibrated fit verdict remains the Club-3090 estimate that includes weights, activation peak, vLLM workspace/cudagraph overhead, drafter residency, and vLLM KV-pool capping behavior.

## General KV cache formula

The unified per-card KV pool math:

```
per_token_bytes = num_growing_layers
                × num_kv_heads
                × head_dim
                × k_v_tensors            ← 2 for K and V stored separately; 1 when K=V tied
                × bytes_per_kv_element   ← see KV-format table below

kv_pool_per_card = (per_token_bytes / TP) × max_ctx × max_num_seqs
```

For hybrid architectures (DeltaNet, SWA), only the **growing** attention layers contribute to this formula. Fixed-window or recurrent-state layers contribute a separate, context-independent term (see per-model sections).

### Variable glossary

| Variable | Meaning | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `num_growing_layers` | Count of attention layers whose KV cache grows with context length | Model card README — **not always in config.json** for hybrid architectures |
| `num_total_layers` | All transformer blocks (attention + DeltaNet + MoE routers + etc.) | `config.json → num_hidden_layers` |
| `num_kv_heads` | Number of KV heads (GQA / MQA factor) | `config.json → num_key_value_heads` |
| `head_dim` | Per-head dimension | `config.json → head_dim` or `hidden_size / num_attention_heads` |
| `k_v_tensors` | 2 when K and V are stored separately; 1 when the model ties K=V | Model card / model code; empirical confirmation via `Available KV cache / card` boot log |
| `bytes_per_kv_element` | Bytes per KV scalar after quantization (see table below) | KV format choice |
| `TP` | Tensor parallel degree | Compose config |
| `max_ctx` | Maximum context length the engine is configured for | Compose config |
| `max_num_seqs` | Maximum concurrent sequences | Compose config |

### `bytes_per_kv_element` by KV format

| KV format | `bytes_per_kv_element` | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | 2.0 | Baseline; no dequant during forward |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `fp8_e4m3` | 1.0 | Requires sm_89+ for `fp8e4nv` (Ampere consumer needs e5m2) |
| `int8_per_token_head` (PR #40391) | ~1.01 | Per-token-head scale adds ~1% overhead; Ampere-friendly |
| `k8v4` | 0.75 | Mixed precision |
| `q4_0` | ~0.56 | Includes packed-quant overhead |
| `turboquant_3bit_nc` (TQ3) | ~0.425 | Genesis-supplied; cheapest KV format on this stack |

**Note on Ampere**: `fp8_e4m3` is NOT supported by the Triton kernel on sm_86 (3090/3090-Ti/A5000). Use `fp8_e5m2` (engine-level fallback) or `int8_per_token_head` (vendored via PR #42102). See [DTYPE_MATRIX.md](DTYPE_MATRIX.md).

### Per-card budget composition (all models)

```
peak ≈ weights/TP                                  ← exact, from checkpoint size
     + kv_pool_growing                             ← formula above
     + kv_pool_fixed                               ← SWA window or recurrent state (context-independent)
     + activation_peak                             ← empirical coefficient per (model, KV format)
     + cudagraph_workspace_overhead                ← empirical fit, ~0.5-1.5 GB
     + drafter_overhead/TP                         ← speculative-decoding drafter weights, if any
```

### DeltaNet recurrent state (DeltaNet-family models only)

Hybrid DeltaNet models (Qwen3-Next family) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state between tokens, separate from the per-token growing KV. This state is tiny but worth noting for completeness:

```
delta_state_bytes ≈ num_gdn_layers
                  × (linear_num_k_heads × linear_k_head_dim
                     + linear_num_v_heads × linear_v_head_dim
                     + linear_conv_kernel_dim × (linear_num_k_heads × linear_k_head_dim
                                                  + linear_num_v_heads × linear_v_head_dim))
                  × 4 (fp32, mamba_ssm_dtype)
                  × max_num_seqs
```

Three components per layer: K state + V state + conv1d kernel state. All four `linear_*` fields are in `config.json → text_config`. Concrete sizes for our models in per-model §"DeltaNet recurrent state" subsections — typically single-digit MB total, negligible vs activation peak.

**Worked example — Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B at `max_num_seqs=1`:**

```
linear_num_k_heads = 16, linear_k_head_dim = 128       → 2,048 elements per layer
linear_num_v_heads = 32, linear_v_head_dim = 128       → 4,096 elements per layer
linear_conv_kernel_dim = 4                              → conv state = 4 × (2,048 + 4,096) = 24,576 elements
num_gdn_layers = 30, fp32 (4 bytes), max_num_seqs = 1

delta_state_bytes = 30 × (2,048 + 4,096 + 24,576) × 4 × 1
                  = 30 × 30,720 × 4
                  = 3,686,400 bytes
                  ≈ 3.5 MB
```

Plug `max_num_seqs = 4` → ~14 MB. Both well below activation-peak scale.

Per-model sections below derive each term concretely.

## Quick reference: per-token growing-KV bytes

Headline numbers for the four shipping models, computed from each per-model formula in the deep sections. Useful for at-a-glance capacity planning.

| Model | bf16 (TP=1 / TP=2) | fp8_e5m2 (TP=1 / TP=2) | INT8 PTH or TQ3 (TP=1 / TP=2) | Vs Qwen 27B† |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 3.6 27B | 65,536 B / 32,768 B | 32,768 B / 16,384 B | **13,927 B / 6,963 B** (TQ3) | **1.00×** (baseline) |
| Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B (MoE) | 20,480 B / 10,240 B | 10,240 B / 5,120 B | **4,352 B / 2,176 B** (TQ3) | **0.31×** (~3.2× lighter) |
| Gemma 4 31B | 163,840 B / 81,920 B | 81,920 B / 40,960 B | ~82,700 B / ~41,400 B (INT8 PTH) | **2.50×** (~2.5× heavier) |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B (MoE) | **10,240 B / 5,120 B** | 5,120 B / 2,560 B | ~5,170 B / ~2,585 B (INT8 PTH) | **0.16×** (~6.4× lighter) |

† Ratio at fp8_e5m2 TP=2 — pick this as the comparison anchor because it's a common production config. Ratios shift slightly under other formats but the family hierarchy is stable.

**What jumps out:**

- **Gemma 4 26B-A4B vs 31B**: ~16× smaller per-token growing KV thanks to asymmetric KV head counts (2 global vs 16). At 200K context + fp8 + TP=2, growing KV per card is ~512 MB for the MoE vs ~8 GB for the 31B. Long-context serving on 24 GB Ampere is dramatically cheaper.
- **Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B vs 27B**: ~3.2× smaller per token (10 growing layers × 2 KV heads vs 16 × 4). The MoE shifts the bottleneck from KV to weights + activation.
- **Sliding-window KV** for Gemma models is **fixed** (not per-token): ~50 MB total (26B-A4B) / ~200 MB total (31B) at bf16. Excluded from per-token math but included in the per-model deep sections.
- **TQ3 (Genesis) only applies to Qwen-family** (DeltaNet kernel dependency); **INT8 PTH (PR #40391/#42102) is the long-context unlock for Gemma family on Ampere**.

## Model architecture summary

| Model | Total layers | Growing layers | Sliding / fixed | KV heads | Head dim | K=V tied | MoE | Special notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Qwen 3.6 27B** | 64 | 16 (full-attention) | 48 (GDN recurrent) | 4 | 256 | No (×2) | No | DeltaNet block-wise activation peak (Cliff 2). `linear_attn` in-proj stays fp16 even under INT4 quant. |
| **Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B** | 40 | **10** (gated attention at idx 3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31,35,39) | 30 (Gated DeltaNet) | **2** | 256 | No (×2) | **Yes (256×8)** | `full_attention_interval=4`: every 4th layer is attention. Built-in MTP (`mtp_num_hidden_layers=1`). `attn_output_gate=True` (gated attention). Vision-capable. Active params ~3B, total 35B. |
| **Gemma 4 31B** | 60 | 10 (full-attention) | 50 (SWA, window=1024) | 16 | 256 sliding / **512 global** | Yes (×1) | No | Global layers use 2× head_dim of sliding layers. K=V tying confirmed empirically against boot-log KV cache reports. |
| **Gemma 4 26B-A4B** | **30** | **5** (full-attention at idx 5,11,17,23,29) | 25 (SWA, window=1024) | **8 sliding / 2 global** (asymmetric) | 256 sliding / **512 global** | **Yes (×1)** | **Yes (128×8)** | Asymmetric KV-head split per layer type. Every 6th layer is global, last layer always global. Per-token growing KV is **~16× smaller** than Gemma 4 31B (see [Gemma section](#gemma-4-26b-a4b-moe--per-card-budget-components)). Vision + audio support. **No Genesis required.** |

> **MoE column format**: `N×K` = `num_experts × num_experts_per_tok` (e.g. "256×8" = 256 experts, 8 active per token).

**Hybrid quirks to internalize:**

- **Growing vs fixed layers**: in hybrid architectures, KV cache scales with `num_growing_layers`, not `num_total_layers`. Confusing them inflates predictions by ~3-6×.
- **DeltaNet recurrent state**: fixed size per layer, irrespective of context. Adds a small constant term (~hundreds of MB), not a per-token term.
- **K=V tying**: when present (Gemma 4 family), KV pool is *half* of what naive `×2` math predicts. Always confirm via boot log — vLLM prints `Available KV cache / card = X GiB` after model load; back-solve `per_token_bytes` against your `max_ctx` to verify the tying assumption.
- **Asymmetric head_dim**: Gemma 4's global layers use 2× the head_dim of sliding layers. The KV formula has to split into two terms.

## Extracting parameters from Hugging Face `config.json`

### What you can reliably get from `config.json`

| Parameter | Usually in config.json? | Key names |
|---|---|---|
| Total layers | Yes | `num_hidden_layers` |
| Attention heads / KV heads | Yes | `num_attention_heads`, `num_key_value_heads` |
| Head dimension | Yes | `head_dim` (or compute via `hidden_size / num_attention_heads`) |
| Sliding window size | Yes (when present) | `sliding_window` |
| GQA / MQA ratio | Yes | `num_key_value_heads < num_attention_heads` |
| Rope theta / scaling | Yes | `rope_theta`, `rope_scaling` |
| MoE basics | Yes (when present) | `num_experts`, `num_experts_per_tok` |
| Vocabulary | Yes | `vocab_size` |
| Linear-attention dims (Qwen3-Next) | Yes (newer Qwen configs) | `linear_num_key_heads`, `linear_key_head_dim`, etc. |

### What is often missing or requires README / code inspection

- **Hybrid layer pattern** (e.g. "10 × (3× DeltaNet → 1× Gated Attention)"). The TOTAL layer count is in `config.json`; the SPLIT between growing and fixed is usually only in the model card README.
- **Which specific layers are growing vs fixed** (when the pattern isn't uniform).
- **K=V tying**. Rarely a config field; check model code (`modeling_*.py`) or empirically verify via boot log.
- **Recurrent state size** for DeltaNet / Mamba / SSM layers.
- **Exact growing layer count** for newest hybrid architectures.

### Worked examples

**Qwen 3.6 27B (dense Qwen3-Next):**

```python
import json
config = json.load(open("/mnt/models/huggingface/qwen3.6-27b-autoround-int4/config.json"))
# Reads directly:
#   num_hidden_layers = 64
#   num_key_value_heads = 4
#   head_dim = 256
# But the split (16 attention vs 48 GDN) is from the model card README,
# not derivable from config.json alone.
```

**Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B (MoE, hypothetical layout once downloaded):**

```python
# config.json gives:
#   num_hidden_layers = 40
#   num_key_value_heads = 2          (typical Qwen3.6 MoE GQA ratio)
#   head_dim = 256                   (for gated attention layers)
#   num_experts = 128                (typical Qwen MoE config)
#   num_experts_per_tok = 8          (active experts per token)
#   linear_num_key_heads = ...       (DeltaNet state dim — present in newer configs)
# Still need from README:
#   The "10 × (3× GDN → MoE → 1× Gated Attn → MoE)" pattern → 10 growing layers
```

**Gemma 4 31B:**

```python
# config.json → text_config gives:
#   num_hidden_layers = 60
#   num_key_value_heads = 16
#   head_dim = 256                   (sliding layers)
#   global_head_dim = 512            (full-attention layers)
#   sliding_window = 1024
# Still need from README / model code:
#   The 5:1 sliding:global interleave pattern → 50 sliding + 10 global
#   K=V tying (`attention_k_eq_v: true` IS in config.json for Gemma 4 — lucky)
```

### Recommended workflow

1. Auto-load `config.json` via `transformers.AutoConfig` or direct JSON parse.
2. Pull every standard field listed above.
3. Cross-check the model card README for: growing-layer count, layer pattern, K=V tying, recurrent state shape.
4. Maintain a **per-model overrides table** (in your calculator or a `MODEL_SPECS` dict) that encodes the README-only quirks.
5. Empirically validate against the boot log on first launch: `docker logs <container> | grep -i "kv cache"` — compare measured per-card KV to predicted.

This is exactly how vLLM, llama.cpp, and SGLang handle it internally: standard fields from config, per-model classes for the architectural quirks.

For our v0.7.0 profile data model, this maps to: `config.json` → automatic; overrides → `scripts/lib/profiles/models/<id>.yml`; calibration → `scripts/lib/profiles/calibration/<id>.yml`. See [ADDING_MODELS.md](ADDING_MODELS.md) for the end-to-end onboarding workflow.

## Qwen 3.6 27B — per-card budget components

For Qwen3.6-27B AutoRound INT4 at TP=N, the per-card VRAM peak during bench is composed of:

```
peak ≈ weights/N + kv_pool + activation_peak + cudagraph_workspace + dflash_draft/N
```

Each term has a well-defined formula or empirical anchor.

### 1. Model weights (`weights / N`)

AutoRound INT4 weights total ~17.5 GB on disk. Under tensor parallelism, weights split across cards:

- TP=1: 17.5 GB / card
- TP=2: 8.75 GB / card
- TP=4: 4.4 GB / card

This term is exact (the checkpoint is a fixed size). DeltaNet's `linear_attn.in_proj_a` / `in_proj_b` layers stay at fp16 in AutoRound quantization (per `extra_config` in `config.json`), but the byte budget is included in the 17.5 GB total.

### 2. KV pool (attention layers only)

In the Qwen3-Next hybrid architecture, **only the 16 full_attention layers contribute to the growing KV cache**. The 48 GDN (Gated DeltaNet) layers maintain a fixed-size recurrent state instead (Yang et al., [Gated Delta Networks ICLR 2025](https://github.com/NVlabs/GatedDeltaNet)).

Applying the general formula:

```
per_token_bytes = 16 (growing layers) × 4 (kv_heads) × 256 (head_dim) × k_v_tensors=2 × bpe
                = 32,768 × bpe bytes
```

| KV format | bpe | per-token KV (TP=1) | per-token KV (TP=2) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | 2.0 | 65,536 B | 32,768 B |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `fp8_e4m3` | 1.0 | 32,768 B | 16,384 B |
| `q4_0` | ~0.56 | 18,350 B | 9,175 B |
| `k8v4` | 0.75 | 24,576 B | 12,288 B |
| `turboquant_3bit_nc` (TQ3) | ~0.425 | 13,927 B | 6,963 B |

Total KV pool (per card) = `per_token_bytes / TP × max_ctx × max_num_seqs`. PagedAttention ([Kwon et al., arxiv 2309.06180](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180)) wastes <4% of this in fragmentation.

**Caveat**: this formula computes *requested* KV pool. vLLM's actual allocation is bounded by `mem_util × VRAM - other_components`. If requested exceeds available, vLLM emits `estimated max model length is N` and refuses to boot — that's the trigger for FAIL verdict.

**Caveat #2**: `max_num_seqs > 1` over-predicts in `kv-calc.py`. Real vLLM rate-limits internally; the calculator doesn't model that. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

### 3. Activation peak (GDN forward — the Cliff 2 mechanism)

The 48 GDN layers materialize a block-wise intermediate state during prefill. This is the source of [Cliff 2](CLIFFS.md#cliff-2--deltanet-gdn-forward-intermediate-buffer).

The PerfMamba paper ([arxiv 2511.22849](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.22849)) measures this directly on the parent architecture: at sequence length 2048, **Mamba-2 SSM consumes 33.5% more memory than Mamba-1 (115.68 GB vs 86.64 GB) due to "block-wise state materialization."** The asymptotic scaling per the paper:

```
activation_peak ∝ γ × D × N × L
```

where γ = expansion factor, D = hidden dim, N = state dim, L = sequence length.

For Qwen3.6-27B's GDN layers, `fla.ops.chunk.chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd` allocates an intermediate `h` shaped `(B, NT, H, V, K)`:

- `B` = batch
- `NT = ceil(seq_len / chunk_size)` chunks (`chunk_size=256`)
- `H` = number of heads (`linear_num_k_heads=16`, `linear_num_v_heads=48`)
- `V`, `K` = head dim (`linear_v_head_dim = linear_k_head_dim = 128`)
- Per-element 4 bytes (`mamba_ssm_dtype = fp32` on this stack)

Published O(γDNL) gives asymptotic scaling but not the absolute coefficient — that depends on `fla.ops.chunk` implementation details (tiling, streaming, register reuse). We use an **empirical coefficient** calibrated against measured BENCHMARKS rows:

| KV format | bytes/layer/token coefficient | Why this differs from fp8 |
|---|---:|---|
| `fp16` / `bf16` | ~135 | Baseline (no KV dequant during forward) |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `fp8_e4m3` | ~130 | Small dequant overhead |
| `q4_0` / `k8v4` | ~155 | Larger dequant + scale ops |
| `turboquant_3bit_nc` | ~165 | TQ3 dequant during the materialized block adds ~20-25% activation pressure |

The TQ3 → fp8 difference (~25%) is what causes the [20 GB Ampere Cliff 2 fire at 90K](HARDWARE.md#note-for-sub-24-gb-cards) — TQ3's larger activation peak exceeds the per-card budget after TP=2 split on smaller-VRAM cards. Cross-rig validated by [@efschu](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/47) on 2× 3080 modded.

### 4. Cudagraph + workspace overhead

vLLM's torch.compile pass captures multiple cudagraph variants (one per `(batch_size, seq_len_bucket)` combination). Each capture costs ~50-100 MB. FlashInfer adds a 394 MB workspace per card. NCCL allreduce buffers cost ~200-300 MB on TP > 1.

Empirical fit:
```
overhead = 0.5 + 1.0 × mem_util + 0.3 × (TP - 1)   # GB
```

This is rough — actual overhead depends on how many graphs vLLM captures, which depends on `max_num_seqs`, `compile_sizes`, and other internals.

### 5. DeltaNet recurrent state (per-stream, constant)

The 48 GDN layers maintain a fixed-size recurrent state between tokens (separate from the block-wise intermediate during forward — that's the activation peak in §3). Concrete size for Qwen 3.6 27B:

- K state: `16 × 128 × fp32 = 8 KB` per layer
- V state: `48 × 128 × fp32 = 24 KB` per layer
- Conv state: `4 × (16×128 + 48×128) × fp32 = ~128 KB` per layer
- **Total per layer: ~160 KB** × 48 layers × `max_num_seqs` streams

At `max_num_seqs=1`: ~7.5 MB total per card. At `max_num_seqs=4`: ~30 MB. Negligible vs activation peak (GB-scale) and KV pool (sub-GB). Listed for completeness; don't model in budget projections.

### 6. DFlash draft model

Only present on `dual-dflash*.yml` composes. `z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash` is a ~1.75 GB draft model (per card, FP16). With TP > 1, the draft itself is sharded.

## Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B (MoE) — per-card budget components

**Status**: **config-verified** (architecture confirmed from on-disk `config.json` 2026-05-15), **calibration pending** (not yet served on this stack — activation coefficients TBD). All architectural numbers below are sourced from the model checkpoint, not estimates.

### Architecture summary

Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B is a Qwen3-Next hybrid MoE (`model_type: qwen3_5_moe`, `architectures: Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration`):

- **40 transformer layers**
- `full_attention_interval: 4` → every 4th layer is full attention; the other 3 are Gated DeltaNet
- `layer_types` array confirms **10 full_attention layers at indices [3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39]** + **30 linear_attention (GDN) layers**
- **2 KV heads** (`num_key_value_heads: 2`) — caps `valid_tp` at `[1, 2]`
- **16 attention heads**, **head_dim: 256**
- **MoE: 256 experts, 8 active per token** (was estimated as 128 — real config has 2× more experts)
- `moe_intermediate_size: 512`, `shared_expert_intermediate_size: 512`
- Built-in MTP drafter (`mtp_num_hidden_layers: 1`) — same pattern as Qwen 3.6 27B
- `attn_output_gate: True` — gated attention
- Vision-capable (`vision_config` + image/video token IDs present)
- Active params: ~3B; total params: 35B

### 1. Model weights

MoE weights are dominated by the expert FFNs. **5 quant variants on disk** as of 2026-05-15:

| Quant | On-disk | Per-card at TP=2 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| AutoRound INT4 (`qwen3.6-35b-a3b-autoround-int4`) | 20 GB | 10 GB | Production; matches our Qwen 3.6 27B AutoRound pipeline |
| GPTQ INT4 (`qwen3.6-35b-a3b-gptq-int4`) | 22 GB | 11 GB | Experimental |
| GGUF (`qwen3.6-35b-a3b-gguf`) | 90 GB | n/a (llama.cpp single-card path) | Multi-bit-depth |
| DFlash variants (`*-dflash`, `*-dflash-gguf`) | variable | n/a | Experimental (z-lab) |
| BF16 unquantized | ~70 GB | 35 GB | Does not fit on 24 GB |

Like the dense Qwen 3.6 27B, DeltaNet `linear_attn` in-projection layers stay at fp16 even under INT4 quantization. The byte count is included in the total checkpoint size.

**Note**: MoE expert weights all live in VRAM (they're sparse-activated at FLOPs level, not at memory level). Don't confuse "active params" with "loaded params" — the budget is for the full 35B.

### 2. KV pool (10 gated-attention layers only)

Applying the general formula:

```
per_token_bytes = 10 (growing layers) × 2 (kv_heads) × 256 (head_dim) × k_v_tensors=2 × bpe
                = 10,240 × bpe bytes
```

Compare to dense Qwen 3.6 27B's 32,768 × bpe: **the MoE's growing-KV is ~3.2× lighter per token**, because both `num_growing_layers` (10 vs 16) and `num_kv_heads` (2 vs 4) are smaller.

| KV format | bpe | per-token KV (TP=1) | per-token KV (TP=2) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | 2.0 | 20,480 B | 10,240 B |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `fp8_e4m3` | 1.0 | 10,240 B | 5,120 B |
| `turboquant_3bit_nc` | ~0.425 | 4,352 B | 2,176 B |

Implication: at 200K context, KV pool per card at TP=2 + fp8 = `5,120 × 200,000 = ~1.02 GB`. **The MoE is KV-light by Qwen-family standards.** The bottleneck shifts to weights + activation peak.

### 3. Activation peak (GDN forward, denser than dense 27B)

Critical: this MoE has **30 GDN layers vs 48 in the dense 27B** — fewer GDN layers means smaller per-layer activation buffer count. But the GDN forward block-wise materialization is per-layer, so the total activation peak scales with `30 × per_layer_coef × seq_len`.

Projected coefficient (untested — will require calibration):

| KV format | Projected bytes/layer/token | Reasoning |
|---|---:|---|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | ~115-130 | Slightly smaller than dense 27B (different `linear_num_k_heads` likely) |
| `fp8_e5m2` | ~110-125 | Same dequant pattern |
| `turboquant_3bit_nc` | ~140-155 | TQ3 dequant overhead similar to dense |

The activation peak should be **~60-70% of dense Qwen 3.6 27B's** (30/48 layers × similar per-layer cost). Calibration TBD.

### 4. MoE-specific considerations

MoE introduces a few new accounting items:

- **Router workspace**: `hidden_size × num_experts × bf16_bytes = 2048 × 256 × 2 = ~1 MB` per router. Across 40 layers ≈ 40 MB. Tiny one-time cost.
- **Expert dispatch buffers**: vLLM allocates buffers for top-k expert routing across all 256 experts. Empirical ~200-400 MB per card.
- **No KV-side impact**: MoE only gates FFN compute. The KV cache for the gated-attention layers is unaffected.

### 5. DeltaNet recurrent state (per-stream, constant)

The 30 GDN layers maintain a fixed-size recurrent state between tokens (separate from the block-wise intermediate during forward, which is the activation peak). Concrete size:

- K state: `linear_num_k_heads × linear_k_head_dim × fp32 = 16 × 128 × 4 = 8 KB` per layer
- V state: `linear_num_v_heads × linear_v_head_dim × fp32 = 32 × 128 × 4 = 16 KB` per layer
- Conv state: `linear_conv_kernel_dim × (16×128 + 32×128) × fp32 = ~96 KB` per layer
- **Total per layer: ~120 KB** × 30 layers × `max_num_seqs` streams

At `max_num_seqs=1`: ~3.5 MB total per card. At `max_num_seqs=4`: ~14 MB. **Negligible** vs activation peak (which is GB-scale) and KV pool (sub-GB). Listed here for completeness; don't bother modelling in budget projections.

### 6. Cudagraph + workspace overhead

Same form as dense models:

```
overhead = 0.5 + 1.0 × mem_util + 0.3 × (TP - 1)   # GB
```

MoE may increase cudagraph capture cost slightly (more dispatch-shape buckets). Expect a small (~100-200 MB) bump in practice.

### Estimated per-card budget at TP=2, 24 GB VRAM

| Term | Value (fp8 KV, 100K ctx, seqs=1) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Weights / 2 | ~11-12 GB | INT4 quant |
| KV pool (10K growing) | ~0.5 GB | Very small |
| Activation peak | ~6-7 GB | 30 GDN × per-layer, fp8 coefficient |
| Cudagraph + overhead | ~1.2 GB | Empirical fit |
| **Predicted peak** | **~19-21 GB** | Fits comfortably on 24 GB, snug on 20 GB |

**Calibration pending**. These are pre-boot projections.

## Gemma 4 31B — per-card budget components

Gemma 4 31B is structurally different from Qwen 3.6:

- **No DeltaNet, no GDN activation peak.** Dense MLP instead.
- **Hybrid on attention type**, not attention-vs-recurrence. The 60-layer stack is `[sliding_attention × 5, full_attention × 1] × 10` = **50 sliding-attention layers + 10 full-attention layers**.
- **Head-dim asymmetry** — sliding layers use `head_dim=256`, full-attention layers use `global_head_dim=512`. Per-token KV bytes for full layers is therefore 2× what naive `num_layers × head_dim` would compute.
- **K==V tying** — `attention_k_eq_v: true` in `config.json`. vLLM's allocator EXPLOITS this — K and V share storage. The KV formula uses `k_v_tensors=1`, not 2. Empirically confirmed against the matched-config rebench's `Available KV cache / card = 10.82 GiB` at 262K seqs=2.

Source: `/mnt/models/huggingface/gemma-4-31b-autoround-int4/config.json` → `text_config`.

```
peak ≈ weights/N + kv_pool_growing + kv_pool_sliding + activation_peak + cudagraph_overhead + drafter_overhead
```

### 1. Model weights (`weights / N`)

| Quant | On-disk | Per-card at TP=2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| AutoRound INT4 (`gemma-4-31b-autoround-int4`) | ~18 GB | 9.0 GB |
| AWQ-4bit (`cyankiwi/gemma-4-31B-it-AWQ-4bit`) | ~17 GB | 8.5 GB |
| BF16 (unquantized) | ~58 GB | 29 GB (does not fit on 24 GB) |

Two shipped quants on this stack: AutoRound INT4 (default) and AWQ-4bit (Tier 2 reproducer of #103). INT4 weights + INT8-per-token-head KV is the matched-config dual-3090 recipe (see `models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/compose/dual/autoround-int4/int8.yml`).

### 2. KV pool — growing portion (10 full-attention layers)

Each stores K and V at `global_head_dim=512`, with K==V tying meaning a single store per element:

```
per_token_bytes_growing = 10 (growing layers) × 16 (kv_heads) × 512 (global_head_dim) × k_v_tensors=1 × bpe
                        = 81,920 × bpe bytes
```

Compare to Qwen 3.6 27B's `32,768 × bpe` — Gemma 4's per-token growing KV is **~2.5× heavier** than Qwen's, despite the K=V tying win. This is *the* reason Gemma 4 at 262K needs INT8 / FP8 KV on Ampere — at BF16 KV the per-card budget blows past 24 GB before reaching 50K context.

Per-token growing-KV bytes by format:

| KV format | bpe | per-token growing KV (TP=1) | per-token (TP=2) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | 2.0 | 163,840 B (~160 KB) | 81,920 B |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `fp8_e4m3` | 1.0 | 81,920 B (~80 KB) | 40,960 B |
| `int8_per_token_head` (PR #40391) | ~1.01 | ~82,700 B | ~41,400 B |
| `q4_0` | ~0.56 | ~45,875 B | ~22,940 B |
| `turboquant_3bit_nc` (TQ3) | ~0.425 | ~34,816 B | ~17,408 B |

Total growing-KV pool per card = `per_token_bytes_growing / TP × max_ctx × max_num_seqs`.

**Note**: on Ampere consumer cards (sm_86), `fp8_e4m3` is NOT supported. Use `int8_per_token_head` (PR #40391, vendored on this stack via PR #42102). See `models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/compose/dual/autoround-int4/int8.yml`.

### 3. KV pool — fixed sliding portion (50 SWA layers)

The 50 sliding-attention layers maintain a fixed-size KV window (`sliding_window=1024`). K==V tying applies here too:

```
sliding_kv_bytes_total = 50 (sliding layers) × 16 (kv_heads) × 256 (head_dim) × k_v_tensors=1 × bpe × 1024 (window)
                       = 209,715,200 × bpe bytes
                       ≈ 200 MB × bpe
```

This is **constant** — it doesn't scale with `max_ctx` or `max_num_seqs`. At fp8 / int8 KV (`bpe=1`), this is ~200 MB per card (TP=1) or ~100 MB at TP=2. Small but non-zero — include it as a separate term.

### 4. Activation peak (SWA prefill + dense MLP)

Unlike Qwen 3.6's GDN block-wise state materialization, Gemma 4's activation peak comes from:

- Sliding-window attention prefill (50 layers, bounded by `sliding_window=1024`)
- Dense MLP intermediate buffer (`hidden_size=5376`, `intermediate_size=21504`)

There's no published scaling-law analogue to PerfMamba's O(γDNL) for Gemma 4. The activation coefficient is **empirical-only**, calibrated against measured BENCHMARKS rows. Expected order of magnitude: ~1.5-2.5 GB at TP=2 dual-card configs (smaller than Qwen 3.6's GDN peak because there's no per-chunk block materialization).

Weak dependence on KV format possible (slight dequant overhead during forward), but expected to be flatter than Qwen's TQ3 → fp8 25% spread — Gemma's dense MLP doesn't dequant KV during forward.

### 5. Cudagraph + workspace overhead

Same form as Qwen — empirical fit:
```
overhead = 0.5 + 1.0 × mem_util + 0.3 × (TP - 1)   # GB
```

vLLM captures multiple cudagraphs (~50-100 MB each), FlashInfer workspace (~394 MB/card), NCCL allreduce buffers (~200-300 MB at TP > 1).

### 6. Drafter overhead

Two drafter families on this stack:

| Drafter | Size | Composes |
|---|---:|---|
| `gemma-4-31b-it-assistant` (Google MTP) | 0.97 GB FP16 | `dual/docker-compose.yml`, `dual/int8.yml`, `dual/awq.yml` (with MTP n=4) |
| `gemma-4-31b-it-dflash` (z-lab DFlash) | 2.9 GB FP16 | `dual/dflash.yml`, `dual/dflash-int8.yml` |

At TP > 1, drafter weights shard across cards (`drafter_gb / TP`).

## Gemma 4 26B-A4B (MoE) — per-card budget components

**Status**: math-ready, **calibration pending**. The model card README is the source of truth for layer pattern; numbers below are estimated from architectural pattern and standard Gemma 4 family conventions. Expect refinement once we download and inspect `config.json` + boot the model.

### Architecture summary

Gemma 4 26B-A4B is a Gemma 4 MoE (`model_type: gemma4`, `architectures: Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`):

- **30 transformer layers** (notably smaller than Gemma 4 31B's 60)
- `layer_types` array confirms **5 full_attention layers at indices [5, 11, 17, 23, 29]** + **25 sliding_attention layers**
- Pattern: every 6th layer is global; **last layer is always global** (per Gemma 4 family convention)
- `sliding_window: 1024`
- **`attention_k_eq_v: True`** — K and V share storage (×1)
- **Asymmetric KV head counts** (the big architectural surprise vs Gemma 4 31B):
  - `num_key_value_heads: 8` — for sliding-attention layers
  - `num_global_key_value_heads: 2` — for full-attention layers
- `head_dim: 256` (sliding), `global_head_dim: 512` (global)
- **MoE: 128 experts, 8 active per token** (`top_k_experts: 8` in config)
- `moe_intermediate_size: 704`
- Multimodal: `vision_config` + `audio_config` token IDs + image/video token IDs present
- **Does NOT require Genesis** (Gemma 4 family has no DeltaNet quirks)
- Active params: ~4B; total params: 26B

### 1. Model weights

| Quant | On-disk | Per-card at TP=2 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Intel AutoRound INT4 mixed** (`gemma-4-26b-a4b-autoround-int4-mixed`) | ~14-15 GB | 7-8 GB | Production target. Mixed precision protects routing-critical layers; matches our AutoRound pipeline. |
| Intel AutoRound INT4 (pure) | ~13 GB | 6.5 GB | Alternative; slightly worse routing quality than mixed. |
| Community AWQ-4bit (cyankiwi) | ~13-14 GB | 6.5-7 GB | Different quant pipeline → activation coefficients don't transfer from our AutoRound calibration. |
| BF16 (unquantized) | ~52 GB | 26 GB | Does not fit on 24 GB. |

MoE expert weights all live in VRAM (sparse-activation at FLOPs level, not at memory). Active-params count (4B) doesn't reduce the loaded budget.

### 2. KV pool — growing portion (5 full_attention layers)

The asymmetric KV head count dramatically reduces per-token growing KV vs Gemma 4 31B:

```
per_token_bytes_growing = num_full_attn_layers × num_global_kv_heads × global_head_dim × k_v_tensors=1 × bpe
                        = 5 × 2 × 512 × 1 × bpe
                        = 5,120 × bpe bytes
```

**Compare to Gemma 4 31B's growing KV** = `10 × 16 × 512 × 1 × bpe = 81,920 × bpe bytes` per token. The 26B-A4B is **~16× lighter per token**:

- Fewer full-attention layers: 5 vs 10
- Fewer KV heads on global layers: 2 vs 16
- Same head_dim and K=V tying

| KV format | bpe | per-token growing KV (TP=1) | per-token (TP=2) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | 2.0 | 10,240 B (~10 KB) | 5,120 B |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `fp8_e4m3` | 1.0 | 5,120 B (~5 KB) | 2,560 B |
| `int8_per_token_head` | ~1.01 | ~5,170 B | ~2,585 B |
| `q4_0` | ~0.56 | ~2,867 B | ~1,434 B |

**Implication**: at 200K context, growing KV pool per card at TP=2 + fp8 = `2,560 × 200,000 = ~512 MB`. **The 26B-A4B is extremely KV-light** — even at full 262K context, growing KV per card is under 700 MB at fp8. The constraint shifts decisively to weights + activation peak, NOT to KV.

This means BF16 KV becomes viable at 262K on Ampere consumer cards (~1.3 GB growing KV per card) — a contrast to Gemma 4 31B where INT8 PTH was the unlock for long context.

### 3. KV pool — fixed sliding portion (25 sliding_attention layers)

The 25 SWA layers maintain a fixed-size KV window (`sliding_window: 1024`):

```
sliding_kv_bytes_total = num_sliding_layers × num_kv_heads × head_dim × k_v_tensors=1 × bpe × sliding_window
                       = 25 × 8 × 256 × 1 × bpe × 1024
                       = 52,428,800 × bpe bytes
                       ≈ 50 MB × bpe
```

**Constant** — doesn't scale with `max_ctx` or `max_num_seqs`. At fp8 KV: ~50 MB per card (TP=1) or ~25 MB at TP=2. Negligible.

Note: this is dramatically smaller than Gemma 4 31B's sliding portion (`50 × 16 × 256 × 1 × bpe × 1024 ≈ 200 MB × bpe`) due to fewer sliding layers (25 vs 50) and fewer KV heads (8 vs 16).

### 4. Activation peak (SWA prefill + dense MoE intermediate buffer)

Same mechanism as Gemma 4 31B (SWA prefill + dense MoE intermediate buffer). MoE adds small per-expert routing overhead but **shouldn't dominate**.

Projected coefficient (calibration pending; expect ≥4 BENCHMARKS rows before locking in):

| KV format | Projected bytes/layer/token | Reasoning |
|---|---:|---|
| `bf16` / `fp16` | ~1.0-1.5 KB | Smaller than Gemma 4 31B due to fewer total layers (30 vs 60) and smaller `hidden_size` (2816 vs 5376) |
| `fp8_e5m2` / `int8_per_token_head` | ~1.0-1.5 KB | Similar to BF16; minimal dequant overhead |

Expected activation peak: ~1-2 GB at TP=2 dual-card configs, but **calibration TBD**.

### 5. MoE-specific considerations

Same accounting as Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B:

- **Router workspace**: `hidden_size × num_experts` = `2816 × 128` ≈ 360 K weights. Tiny (~700 KB at BF16). One-time cost.
- **Expert dispatch buffers**: vLLM allocates buffers for top-k expert routing. Empirical ~200-400 MB per card.
- **No KV-side impact**: MoE only gates FFN compute. KV cache for full-attention layers is unaffected.

### 6. Cudagraph + workspace overhead + drafter

Same empirical form as Gemma 4 31B; standard `0.5 + 1.0 × mem_util + 0.3 × (TP - 1) GB`.

**Drafter family**:
- `google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-assistant` released as MTP drafter (~0.5-1 GB, FP16). Same pattern as our existing `gemma-4-31b-it-assistant` drafter.
- `z-lab/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-DFlash` released as DFlash drafter (community).

### Estimated per-card budget at TP=2, 24 GB VRAM

| Term | Value (fp8 KV, 200K ctx, seqs=1) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Weights / 2 | ~7-8 GB | AutoRound INT4 mixed (~14-15 GB on-disk) |
| KV pool growing | ~0.5 GB | Asymmetric KV heads + few global layers |
| KV pool sliding | ~0.05 GB | Constant; trivially small |
| Activation peak | ~1-2 GB | Smaller than Gemma 4 31B |
| Cudagraph + overhead | ~1.2 GB | Empirical fit |
| MoE expert dispatch buffers | ~0.3 GB | Per-card |
| **Predicted peak** | **~10-12 GB** | Massive headroom on 24 GB; could likely run at higher mem_util or push to BF16 KV at full 262K |

**Calibration pending**. The headline finding to verify on first boot: Gemma 4 26B-A4B at full 262K context should fit on a single 3090 with INT4 weights — single-card serving may be the right default for this model.

## Best practices for building a KV calculator

If you're extending `kv-calc.py` for a new model — or building a similar tool from scratch — these practices reduce errors:

### 1. Auto-load standard fields, override the architectural quirks

Don't hand-author what `config.json` already encodes. Auto-load `num_hidden_layers`, `num_kv_heads`, `head_dim`, `sliding_window`, MoE counts. Keep a per-model overrides dict for hybrid layer split, K=V tying, recurrent state shape.

### 2. Encode `k_v_tensors` explicitly

Don't bake `×2` into per_token_bytes. Use the named variable `k_v_tensors` and set it per model (2 default, 1 when K=V tied). This makes K=V tying surface visible and reviewable.

### 3. Separate growing-KV from fixed-KV

For hybrid models, the math has two terms that scale differently:

- `kv_pool_growing` scales with `max_ctx × max_num_seqs`
- `kv_pool_fixed` is constant (SWA window or recurrent state size)

Compute and report them separately. Lumping them hides the asymptotic behavior.

### 4. Validate against the boot log

vLLM prints `Available KV cache / card = X GiB` after model load. Back-solve:

```
predicted_per_token_bytes = (X × 1024^3) / (max_ctx × max_num_seqs / TP)
```

Compare to your formula's `per_token_bytes`. If off by 2×, suspect K=V tying. If off by `num_layers / num_growing_layers`, you've counted the wrong layer set.

### 5. Empirical coefficients need ≥4 calibration anchors

The activation peak coefficient isn't first-principles — it's an empirical fit. Don't ship a model spec without ≥4 BENCHMARKS.md rows for that model at varying (KV format, max_ctx, max_num_seqs) configs. Fewer anchors → coefficients overfit and predict wrong.

### 6. Mark calibration status explicitly

If a model section is math-derived but uncalibrated, say so clearly in the doc (as the MoE sections above do). Don't quote a prediction as fact without a measured anchor.

### 7. Use `mem_util × VRAM` as the ceiling

vLLM's `gpu_memory_utilization` (default 0.92 on this stack) caps everything except its own internal overheads. Your predicted peak should compare against `mem_util × VRAM`, not raw VRAM.

### 8. Use the `--calibration` self-test

Track predicted-vs-measured verdict accuracy on shipped composes. Target ≥80% within ±1.5 GB. If accuracy drops after a code change, the math regressed.

## Known limitations

The calculator is empirically calibrated, not first-principles. Specifically:

1. **KV pool capping (resolved 2026-05-13)**. Earlier versions over-predicted FAIL on configs with `max_num_seqs > 1` because the requested KV pool exceeded available budget. The current calculator models vLLM's PagedAttention capping: predicted KV pool is `min(requested, budget - fixed_components)`. When the request exceeds available, verdict is `TIGHT` with a note that effective concurrency at `--max-num-seqs` may be lower than requested at full `max_ctx`. The "predicted total" in TIGHT cases equals the budget exactly — that's saturating-allocator behavior, not a modeling artifact.

2. **Activation coefficient varies by `chunk_size` and `dtype`**. We use the fla default `chunk_size=256` and `mamba_ssm_dtype=float32` (per Qwen3.6-27B config.json). If those change, the coefficient needs re-calibration. For Gemma the activation peak is a flat empirical constant; if Gemma config changes (e.g. layer-pattern ratio, sliding_window), recalibrate.

3. **No driver/allocator overhead modeling**. snoby's 4090 needed `max-model-len` 200K → 180K vs 3090 baseline. The driver-class delta isn't modeled here. We hand-wave with the `±1.5 GB` error band.

4. **No Cliff 2b accumulation modeling**. The multi-turn fragmentation cliff at ~25K accumulated tokens is empirical-only and not in this calculator. Use `SOAK_MODE=continuous` to probe it.

5. **MoE models are math-ready but not yet calibrated**. The Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B and Gemma 4 26B-A4B sections above derive math from architectural patterns; absolute numbers (activation coefficients, drafter sizes) ship as estimates until we measure them on the stack. Don't quote them as production-grade predictions.

6. **Per-model calibration required**. Adding a fifth model means deriving a new `MODEL_SPEC` block (architecture params + per-quant weights size + activation-peak mechanism) and calibrating the activation coefficient against ≥4 measured BENCHMARKS rows. Don't ship a new model spec without that.

## Calibration

Run `bash tools/kv-calc.py --calibration` to see predicted vs measured for all shipped composes, grouped per model.

| Model | Verdict accuracy | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen 3.6 27B | 11/11 = 100% (±1.5 GB band) | Refactored Phase 3 of v0.7.0 preserved this byte-for-byte |
| Gemma 4 31B | 7/7 = 100% (±1.5 GB band) | Calibrated against `dual/int8.yml` 98K+262K rows, `dual/dflash.yml`, `dual/awq.yml`, `dual/docker-compose.yml` |
| Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B | not on stack | Pending download + first calibration |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B | not on stack | Pending download + first calibration |

Overall on calibrated models: **18/18 (100%)** as of 2026-05-14.

## When to trust the calculator vs vLLM's boot log

Always pass `--model {qwen3.6-27b,gemma-4-31b}` matching the compose you're targeting. Defaults to qwen3.6-27b if omitted.

| Question | Use this |
|---|---|
| "Will it boot?" — for a *shipped* compose on canonical 24 GB | We've already validated; check BENCHMARKS.md |
| "Will it boot?" — for a *novel* config (custom ctx, kv format, or VRAM class) | `kv-calc.py --model <M> --compose <X>` for a directional answer; then boot and read `gpu_worker.py` |
| "What's my max ctx?" — given my hardware | `kv-calc.py --model <M> --solve-max-ctx ...` for an estimate; vLLM's pre-check `estimated max model length is N` line at boot is authoritative |
| "Is TQ3 or fp8 better for my hardware?" (Qwen 3.6) | `kv-calc.py --model qwen3.6-27b` with both options; cross-check [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md#note-for-sub-24-gb-cards) |
| "Is INT8 PTH or BF16 KV better for Gemma 4?" | `kv-calc.py --model gemma-4-31b --kv-format bf16` vs `int8_per_token_head` — BF16 caps at ~32K on dual-3090, INT8 PTH unlocks 262K. See `models/gemma-4-31b/vllm/compose/dual/autoround-int4/int8.yml` header. |

## Sources of error & accuracy

The ±1.5 GB error band on shipped predictions decomposes as:

| Source | Typical magnitude | Mitigation |
|---|---:|---|
| Activation coefficient empirical fit | ±0.5 GB | More calibration anchors per model (≥4 BENCHMARKS rows) |
| Cudagraph capture variance | ±0.3 GB | The 0.5 + 1.0×mem_util + 0.3×(TP-1) fit is rough |
| FlashInfer workspace per card | ±0.1 GB | Constant; small drift between vLLM nightlies |
| Driver/allocator overhead (cross-rig) | ±0.5 GB | Unmodeled; affects 4090 vs 3090 etc. |
| PagedAttention fragmentation | <4% of KV pool | PagedAttention paper bounds; not separately modeled |
| K=V tying detection (if missed) | 2× KV pool | Validate against boot log; explicit `k_v_tensors=1` annotation |
| Wrong growing-layer count | 3-6× KV pool | Read model card README, not just config.json |

**Where the ±1.5 GB band is too tight**:

- MoE models with unmeasured activation coefficients (current state of Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B + Gemma 4 26B-A4B sections)
- Novel context regimes outside calibration range (e.g. predicting 500K context when calibrated only up to 262K)
- Configs with `max_num_seqs ≥ 4` — the cap modeling produces TIGHT verdicts where measured may be FITS or vice versa

**Where the band is conservative**:

- Single-stream configs (`max_num_seqs=1`) at moderate context (≤200K) — typically ±0.5 GB
